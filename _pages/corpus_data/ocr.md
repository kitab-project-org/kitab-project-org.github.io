KITAB uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools to further build the OpenITI/KITAB corpus. OCR now forms an integral part of OpenITI's corpus expansion, with a large number of texts (nearly 2000) soon to enter the corpus through OCR. OpenITI and KITAB are now working intensively on the development of models for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR), see further on the [OpenITI website](https://openiti.org/).

# eScriptorium

[eScriptorium](https://escripta.hypotheses.org/escriptorium-video-gallery) has been at the centre of OpenITI's efforts to expand the corpus. It provides an open source environment for running [Kraken](http://kraken.re/), correcting layout and transcriptions and training new OCR/HTR models. The team uses it to evaluate the performance of current models, produce data and train models. During the second phase of the Mellon funded [Arabic-script OCR Catalyst Project (AOCP)](https://openiti.org/projects/OpenITI%20AOCP%20Phase%20Two.html), hundreds of pages of corrected transcription have been produced in eScriptorium for Arabic, Persian, Urdu and Ottoman Turkish and used to train models and prepare digital editions. During this phase of the grant, OpenITI also worked to expand the use of eScriptorium within the field. Coupled with the improving performance of Kraken models for Arabic script, eScriptorium is being increasingly adopted as a tool for Arabic-script OCR and HTR.

# KITAB's OCR Pipeline

For larger batch OCR, KITAB also uses an internal pipeline. KITAB'S own OCR pipeline is based on [Kraken](http://kraken.re/) and uses transcription models that we are training in close collaboration with the University of Maryland, Northeastern University and Harvard University.

In its most recent version, KITAB's OCR pipeline uses Kraken version 3.0.0.0b21.dev6, the Kraken default segmentation model and the 04-01-2021_ArabPersGeneralized.mlmodel transcription model.

Our OCR pipeline outputs plain text files, alto xml files and yml metadata files.

Notwithstanding several automated post-correction steps and greatly improved character accuracy rates, OCR output currently still requires manual post-correction. The latter happens either directly on the plain text files or in [eScriptorium](https://escripta.hypotheses.org/escriptorium-video-gallery).

If post-correction takes place in eScriptorium, the alto xml output is loaded into eScriptorium together with the image files.

This allows not only efficient post-correction but also the creation of further training data, including line and region annotation.

Currently, our OCR pipeline allows OCR'ing Arabic, Persian and, to a lesser extent, Urdu texts.

# OCR and OpenITI URIs

Usage of OCR is reflected in the unique resource identifiers (URIs) of the resulting files, all of which contain 'Kraken' or 'EScr' and the date of their creation in the form of either YYMMDDHH or YYMMDDHHSS in their [versionID]({{ "/corpus/use#uri-structure" | relative_url }}).

For example, Ibn Ê¿Arabi's *Fusus al-hikam* was added to the OpenITI/KITAB corpus through OCR and therefore carries the following URI: [0638IbnCarabi.FususHikam.Kraken21042913-ara1](https://github.com/OpenITI/0650AH/blob/master/data/0638IbnCarabi/0638IbnCarabi.FususHikam/0638IbnCarabi.FususHikam.Kraken21042913-ara1.completed).

The specific version of Kraken as well as the segmentation and transcription models used during the OCR process are documented in the [version yml files of the OCR'd text](https://github.com/OpenITI/0650AH/blob/master/data/0638IbnCarabi/0638IbnCarabi.FususHikam/0638IbnCarabi.FususHikam.Kraken21042913-ara1.yml).
