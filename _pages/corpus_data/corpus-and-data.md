The KITAB team works to develop a curated [corpus]({{ '/corpus/about' | relative_url }}) of Arabic texts to which we apply various [digital methods]({{ '/methods' | relative_url }}). These methods produce [data sets]({{ '/data' |  relative_url }}) that we use to better understand the corpus and Arabic book history and to answer different research questions.

You can search the metadata of the corpus and access the texts [here](https://kitab-project.org/metadata). 
In the sections that follow, you can learn about the corpus, about the manner in which it is created, curated and structured, and about our data and the [applications]({{ '/data/apps' | relative_url }}) and [visualisations]({{ '/data/viz' | relative_url }}) that we are developing to help us and other researchers understand our data.
