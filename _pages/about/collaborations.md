The Invisible East at the University of Oxford is a research programme that examines the history of the 8th-13th century Islamicate world in Iran, Afghanistan, Central Asia, western China and northern India/Pakistan, bringing the medieval Islamicate East to the forefront of historical and philological research. The team studies 500-1000 documents written in New Persian, Judeo-Persian, Arabic, Bactrian, Sogdian. Khotanese, and Middle Persian and, in doing so, also sheds new light on politica,l financial, and legal infrastructures, and religious diversity of the region. IE is contributing a machine-readable corpus of its documentary sources to the KITAB project to be hosted by the OpenITI, and to be made freely available to all via GitHub and Zenodo open access platforms.
