# Message from the PI 

KITAB provides a digital tool-box and a forum for discussions about Arabic texts. We wish to empower users to explore Arabic texts in completely new ways and to expand the frontiers of knowledge about one of the world’s largest and most complex textual traditions.

We are leading with a tool that detects how authors copied previous works. Arabic authors frequently made use of past works, cutting them into pieces and reconstituting them to address their own outlooks and concerns. Now you can discover relationships between these texts and also the profoundly intertextual circulatory systems in which they sit.

Our most recent work has involved gathering statistics on reuse across the tradition. This includes the extent and precision of reuse, and where it does and does not occur. We are also developing new visualisations that show the relationships between authors, books, and the ideas that they contain. Equally importantly, we are building the corpus of texts upon which our research is based, and making use of our pioneering work on Optical Character Recognition.

The technology that powers KITAB is at the cutting edge of computer science and we are deeply indebted to our partners. Our first algorithm has been developed by David Smith of Northeastern University. Gregory Crane (editor-in-chief of the Perseus Digital Library and the Alexander von Humboldt Chair in the Digital Humanities at Leipzig University) has been a major collaborator from the start on many aspects of the project. For funding, we are grateful to the support that we have received from the Aga Khan University and the British Academy.

To use our corpus and search tools, please start with "Our Pilot." This provides you with a brief view into the sort of data and tools that we are creating. It is only a sample. We are applying for funding that would allow us to bring all of our data and sources into the public domain.

Thank you for your interest in KITAB!

Kind regards,<br>

### Sarah Bowen Savant
#### Associate Professor, AKU-ISMC, and Principle Investigator of KITAB
Dr Savant is a cultural historian specialising in the Middle East and Iran ca. 600-1500. Her work on KITAB is motivated by a desire to write a cultural history of the Arabic book using digital tools. Her publications include The New Muslims of Post-Conquest Iran: Tradition, Memory, and Conversion (Cambridge University Press, 2013; winner of the Said-Sirjani book award given by the International Society for Iranian Studies on behalf of the Persian Heritage Foundation); as editor (with Helena de Felipe), Genealogy and Knowledge in Muslim Societies: Understanding the Past (AKU-ISMC, Exploring Muslim Contexts/Edinburgh University Press, 2014); as translator (with Peter Webb), The Excellence of the Arabs. A Translation of Ibn Qutaybah’s *Faḍl al-ʿArab wa l-tanbīh ʿalā ʿulūmihā* (The Library of Arabic Literature/New York University Press, 2017); and numerous articles treating ethnic identity, cultural memory, genealogy, and history writing. She serves as president of Middle East Medievalists and as an ex-officio member of the editorial board of its online, open-access journal, Al-ʿUsur al-Wusta. She is also a board member of the British Institute for the Study of Iraq, and a member of the editorial board of its journal, Iraq. In 2016-17, she was a mid-career fellow of the British Academy and a fellow at the Leiden University Centre for the Study of Islam and Society. During that time she prepared much of her next book, based on KITAB’s data: A Cultural History of the Arabic Book (Leiden: Brill, 2019, expected).

**Maxim Romanov** is a Universitätsassistent für Digital Humanities at the Institute for History, University of Vienna. His dissertation (Near Eastern Studies, U of Michigan, 2013) explored how modern computational techniques of text analysis can be applied to the study of premodern Arabic historical sources. In particular, he studied “The History of Islam” (Taʾrīḫ al-islām), the largest of surviving biographical collections with over 30,000 biographies, written by the Damascene scholar al-Ḏahabī (d. 1348 CE). Currently, he continues his study of this biographical collection (The History of Islam: An Essay in Digital Humanities), which will serve as methodological and infrastructural foundation for the study of all surviving Arabic biographical collections and chronicles. Additionally, besides KITAB, he is working on other foundational projects for the field of Arabic and Islamic studies, which include  the OpenITI (former OpenArabic), a machine-readable corpus of classical Arabic texts, and al-Ṯurayyā, a gazetteer of the classical Islamic world.

# Research Based on KITAB

## Cultural Memory in the Pre-Modern Middle East: Köprülü 01589, A Library Manuscript

This paper features my first application of KITAB’s text reuse detection methods to a manuscript transcription. It was delivered Nov. 22, 2015 at the Middle East Studies Annual Meeting in Denver for a panel entitled “Imagining the Ummah.” The panel papers focused on the composition, meaning, and reception of sources pertaining to the first centuries of the Muslim community (600-1000). The paper’s contents (which reflect oral delivery, the audience, and the 20 minute time limit) will be revised, expanded, and incorporated into my 2017 University of Leiden LUCIS lectures.

## Oxford PhD Thesis uses KITAB to Assess Reception History of Major Arabic Book on the Early Caliphate

The *Futūḥ al-buldān* by Aḥmad Ibn Yaḥyā al-Balādhurī (died c. 892) is a most important source for our knowledge of the early Islamic caliphate. In his 2016 Oxford PhD thesis, Ryan Lynch uses KITAB to identify the types of material that later authors borrowed from the *Futūḥ*. He is the first scholar to extensively study the reception of the *Futūḥ* and shows the significant impact al-Balādhurī’s book had on subsequent generations. Later authors liberally borrowed from al-Balādhurī’s book, often without giving him credit. A famous work on geography from the thirteenth century known as the *Muʿjam al-buldān* ("Dictionary of Countries"), for example, features verbatim material from almost every part of al-Balādhurī’s book – running from the Prophet Muḥammad’s *hijra* to Medina through to the conquests of South Asia.
