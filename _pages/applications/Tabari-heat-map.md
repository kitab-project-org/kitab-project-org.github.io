On this page you can find an example of text reuse data for al-Tabari's *Taʾrikh* viewed as a heat map, produced by Peter Verkinderen. For more information on the visualisation and guidance on how to use it, see Peter's [blog post]({{'/New-KITAB-visualizations' | relative_url }}) on it and other visualisations.
