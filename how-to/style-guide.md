## **General principles:**

-   British spellings (favour, not favor; organise, not organize; acknowledgements, not acknowledgments; practise as verb, not practice)

-   Single quotation marks, with doubles only for quotations within quotations

-   Commas and full stops follow a closing quotation mark, except if they belong in the quotation:

> He uses the phrase ‘he told us’.
>
> Savant, ‘People vs. Books’, 2–3.
>
> She said, ‘Show me the data.’

-   References given in full at first mention and in shortened form thereafter

-   Arabic transliteration follows the *International Journal of Middle East Studies* (e.g. *sīra*, Abū al-Qāsim, *bi-l-lafẓ*)

-   Blog posts and website pages omit all diacritics except for hamza (ʾ) and ʿayn (ʿ); however, quotations may retain original diacritics

## **Finer details:**

### Format:

-   12-point Calibri font

-   All text single-spaced

-   In blog post titles, all major words are capitalised, but articles, conjunctions and prepositions are usually left lowercase (the, as, but, and, between …)

-   In subheadings within blog posts and web pages, only the first word and any proper nouns are capitalised

-   For blog posts, aim for short sentences and paragraphs

-   Images need to be in high resolution, not screenshots

-   Quotations longer than forty words are extracted and indented on the left, without quotation marks

-   Translations of titles are given in parentheses, enclosed in quotation marks with minimal capitalisation: *Nahj al-balāgha* (‘The peak of eloquence’)

### Numbers:

-   Spelled out in words up to 99 and given in figures thereafter, but always in figures with units of measurement, parts of books and ages: 5km, chapter 5, volumes 1–3, Figure 1, at the age of 12 (but: ‘a book with five chapters’; ‘a ten-year-old debate’)

-   Ranges compressed to the smallest number of digits, except for numbers in the teens: 23–4, 112–13, 568–71

-   Dual AH/CE years and ranges separated by a slash: 255–6/869–70

-   Numbered lists: in running text, use (1) numbers and (2) parentheses; when extracted, use

> 1\. numbers
>
> 2\. without parentheses

### Punctuation:

-   Spaced en rule, not em rule, for interjections – such as this – within the text

-   Unspaced en rule for number ranges and when ‘to’ is meant: Oxford–London train

-   No comma before the third item in a list, unless required for clarity:

> cats, dogs and mice
>
> He cites his teachers, Dāwūd al-Ẓāhirī, and Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal.

-   Three dots (or the three-dot character) for ellipsis … with a space before and after

-   No full stop at the end of an abbreviation that consists of capitals (UK, US) or ends with the original final letter (vols, eds, Dr)

-   No comma after i.e. and e.g.
