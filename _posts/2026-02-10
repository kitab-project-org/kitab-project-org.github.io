title: Calling for OpenITI Curators (information session)
---

Would you like to help build and diversify the OpenITI corpus? We are proud to announce the beginning of the OpenITI sub-corpus curator programme. 

We are organising a first online information session on these curatorships on **Thursday 12 February at 3pm UK time** (places are limited as we want to give everyone time to talk). Please fill in the form below if you would like to attend (or if you're interested but are not able to attend). You'll receive the zoom link via email. 

Curators will choose one or more of the following tasks for texts within their specialism:

- identify which works are not yet in the corpus (e.g, comparing the texts in the corpus with relevant bibliographies);
- encourage colleagues to include texts they have edited/transcribed to the corpus;
- collect digital text versions and PDFs of missing works;
- OCR missing works for inclusion in the corpus;
- coin and correct Unique Resource Identifiers (URIs) for authors and books (OpenITI URIs consist of the author’s death date and name plus book title, e.g. 0255Jahiz.Hayawan, 0310Tabari.Tarikh);
- enrich metadata (e.g, add biographical information about authors, flag issues with the quality of specific editions);
- if more than one version of a text is in the corpus, decide which version should be the primary version;
- annotate the structure of texts (section headers), or double-check the existing annotation;
...

In addition, curators will be the first point of contact if the corpus manager needs expert advice on texts within their subdomain.

Curatorships will be voluntary positions, initially for the duration of one year.

If you are interested go to this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=KiXUpfkCYE6W8Jczuq5JGaw9bGDHZApGgUU0ruAI1A9UOVFQT1YwUU85V041NVlXTlRGUlA3S1NUNyQlQCN0PWcu) to express interest and we will send an invite to join our first information session.

If you are unable to make this session, also fill in the form and we will make you aware of future sessions.
