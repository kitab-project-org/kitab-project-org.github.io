Please join us for an online ‘Open House’ convened by the Centre for Digital Humanities at the Aga Khan University (International) in the United Kingdom and the KITAB project.

This is the third session of what we hope will be regular Open Houses where anyone working with Arabic texts can join, learn about Digital Humanities work in Arabic today, pick up skills, and meet other researchers.

CDH researchers will present a number of case studies based on the KITAB data and visualisations. Attendees will have the chance to explore data and texts related to their own interests with assistance provided by CDH researchers.
