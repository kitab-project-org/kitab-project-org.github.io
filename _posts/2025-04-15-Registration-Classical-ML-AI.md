**Workshop: From Classical ML to AI in Arabic and Islamic Studies: A Hands-On Workshop, July 1-4, 2025**

**Dates**: July 1-4, 2025

**Location**: University of Hamburg, Afrika-Asien Institut

We are excited to announce the upcoming hands-on workshop, "From Classical ML to AI in Arabic and Islamic Studies," taking place from July 1st to 4th, 2025, at the University of Hamburg's Afrika-Asien Institut. This workshop is part of the Emmy Noether Project "Evolution of Islamic Societies (600-1600): Algorithmic Analysis into Social History," [EIS1600], funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

This workshop is designed to equip participants with the necessary skills to apply both classical machine learning techniques and the latest AI technologies in the study of Arabic and Islamic texts. Participants will gain practical experience and theoretical knowledge, enabling them to harness these cutting-edge technologies in their research. A working knowledge of Python is required. We will use Arabic texts from the OpenITI Corpus as our data.

This event is ideal for researchers in the fields of Arabic and Islamic studies who are eager to integrate the latest technologies into their work and to make bold contributions to the evolving landscape of humanistic research in our fast-paced digital age.
