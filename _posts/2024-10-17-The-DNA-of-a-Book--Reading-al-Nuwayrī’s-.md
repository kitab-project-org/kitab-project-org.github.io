We [[released]{.underline}](https://zenodo.org/records/13145269) a data set of an experiment conducted by Sarah Bowen Savant and Sohail Merchant, who wanted to understand potentially how, and from what, Shihāb al-Dīn al-Nuwayrī (d. 733/1333) created his *Nihāyat al-arab fī funūn al-adab* (*The Ultimate Ambition in the Arts of Erudition*), one of the best-known and most highly regarded encyclopaedias of the medieval Islamic world. The work has been studied extensively by Elias Muhanna and other scholars. Muhanna produced an abridged translation (with the above title) and also a 2018 study of the book: *The World in a Book: Al-Nuwayri and the Islamic Encyclopedic Tradition* (Princeton University Press).

The data is based on the text reuse alignments (generated by the [[KITAB project]{.underline}](https://kitab-project.org/)) between the *Nihāya* and all other works in the [[OpenITI corpus (version 2022.1.6)]{.underline}](https://zenodo.org/records/6808108), where the death date of the author precedes 735 AH. The data will be analysed by Sarah Bowen Savant in a forthcoming monograph under contract with Edinburgh University Press. Specifically, she wanted to understand how an author such as al-Nuwayrī picked up and put down sources when writing across a long work such as the *Nihāya*. She also wanted to be able to judge which of two or more sources an author most likely used, when there are multiple alignments to different sources for the same piece of text within a work. As she will argue with the data and visualisations, with the *Nihāya*, there is significant pass-through reuse where al-Nuwayrī reuses an earlier author's writing through an intermediary's work, but al-Nuwayrī sometimes also will go straight back to the earlier work.
