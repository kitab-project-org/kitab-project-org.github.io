&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research workshop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co-hosted by the Aga Khan University, Institute for the Study of Muslim Civilisations and SOAS, University of London&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 to 8 October 2022&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aga Khan Centre, London &amp;amp; Online&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This annual exploratory and informal workshop not only offers the opportunity to reflect on history writing in Arabic, but also invites contributors to explore more broadly how people relate to the past. We encourage contributions focused on methodologies, research agendas, and case studies related to Arabic in any region and in any period from the seventh century to the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Papers might elucidate questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How and in which terms do people refer to the past? How and in which terms do they refer to memory? What is the relation between history and memory, and between memory and space? How does the past sit in people’s bodies – and in the body politic?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through what practices of writing or otherwise encoding the past and of remembering and forgetting, have different groups in the Middle East and North Africa viewed their pasts? At different times and places, was the significant past the same for court historians as for literary historians; for bureaucrats as for the military; for Sufis as for Muslim lawyers and Traditionists?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From what perspective have histories been written and what makes them coherent? How have past events been rendered intelligible? When do particular views of the past start to fall apart? Which categories and boundaries are seen as primordial and which are not? Which beings have been seen as capable of influencing events and when?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do people connect the/their living and the/their dead conceptually? When are past events really over and when can they be laid to rest? Under which circumstances is the past revived? Why do some past lives or events inspire action and others do not? How does unresolved conflict inform thinking about and using the past?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did non-Muslims and Muslims, men and women, adherents of different confessional or juristic traditions, or speakers of different languages, within societies that became “Islamic” imagine the shape and meaning of their specific societies’ own pasts, and their relation to the universal history of the Islamic community?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How have urban and rural people, workers and peasants, the religiously educated and the technocratic elite, developed different ways of writing, remembering, or commemorating particular events in, or the broad sweep of, local, national, or “Islamic” history?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In what ways do educational institutions, museums, media organizations and proponents of heritage use history writing in Arabic to shape loyalties and senses of belonging in the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe? How do recent discourses in the West shape discussions of history in the Middle East?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can digital methods now enhance or change our understandings of the past? What additional information and perspectives do they offer? (How) do they limit our understanding? What are practical challenges when we apply digital methods to Arabic history? What seem to be particularly promising approaches?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contributions are invited from scholars at all career levels, addressing any period and any part of the Middle East and North Africa, broadly defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we anticipate running the workshop from the Aga Centre in London, with the possibility to have an online component featuring participants who are unable to travel to the UK. As in past years, there is a small budget to provide some travel assistance for scholars outside of London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arabic Pasts is co-organized by Hugh Kennedy (SOAS), James McDougall (Oxford), Lorenz Nigst (AKU-ISMC), and Sarah Bowen Savant (AKU-ISMC).&lt;/p&gt;

Within the KITAB project we spend the bulk of our time fine-tuning the methods of text reuse and the data it provides on the corpus’ many textual relationships, but we are aware that this is not necessarily the primary interest in digital texts for many scholars. As the continued popularity of the Shamela library and its software suggests, one of the most important functions of a corpus of digital texts is its searchability: scholars want to be able to search for information and locate the usage of names, words and phrases across a vast corpus. In the long run we hope to develop a complex search app by which users will be able to search the OpenITI corpus online, but our colleague Aslisho Qurboniev discovered that doing so is in fact already possible with both of the two text editors we recommend to read texts from the corpus: EditPad Pro and Kate. This is a great and easy method to do searches and it is more reliable than using Shamela. For guidance on installing these editors and the mARkdown highlighting scheme, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitab-project.org/docs/openITI#5-software-versions-and-installation&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. (Installing the highlighting scheme is not absolutely necessary for simply searching the corpus, but it is nice to be able to fold texts and see the structural tagging to help navigation.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post I will explain the method for doing this kind of search in Kate, as this text editor is available for free and functions well on both Mac and Windows. Its only disadvantage is that loading large files takes a little while, and sometimes temporarily freezes the app. The EditPad Pro method follows a similar process and is explained briefly in an appendix at the end of this blog. In the second part of the blog I briefly zoom in on some search results I have come across by using this method for the phrase ‘ikhwan al-safaʾ’, which was famously used by an enigmatic early scientific and philosophical community who wrote a compendium known as the Epistles of the Pure Brethren (&lt;em&gt;Rasaʾil ikhwan al-safaʾ&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;searching-the-corpus-with-kate&quot;&gt;Searching the corpus with Kate&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do a search on the OpenITI corpus using this method, it is necessary to download the OpenITI corpus onto your computer. The easiest way to do this is by downloading one of the fixed corpus releases we release twice a year. The most recent release can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3082463&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Please note that the current release will take up five gigabytes on your hard drive. With further releases this will likely increase as the corpus is ever expanding. We are also thinking about doing a separate release with only primary texts (that is, no secondary versions of the same text) in the future. For your own convenience it will be best if you move the folder to an easily retrievable location after downloading, for example in your Documents folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you download the OpenITI corpus as a release, all author files will be in a single folder (and not subdivided into quarter centuries like on GitHub) with their books included in their respective subfolder. You can simply direct EditPad Pro or Kate to search through the general OpenITI folder and it will then take into account all these subfolders. If you are interested in the uptake of words and phrases in a particular period, you could create a specific subfolder and copy those texts that fall within that period into a separate folder and direct the text editor to search through it instead of the whole folder. Alternatively, you could also simply download individual text files or 25 year folders you are interested in directly from GitHub and save them in a folder to create your own subcorpus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have downloaded the corpus, launch the Kate app, click the 'Search and replace' tab, which in Image 1 below is on the bottom left of the app (or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F on Windows = Cmd+Alt+F on Mac). This will open a dialog box in which you can change the location where Kate will conduct the requested search: either in ‘current file’, in all ‘open files', or 'In Folder'. It is this last option we will use to search through the whole OpenITI corpus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2022-02-09/gowaart_van_den_bossche/media/image6.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2022-02-09/gowaart_van_den_bossche/media/image6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image 1: The basic search window in Kate editor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the 'In folder' option has been marked, you only have to tell Kate where the folder you want it to look through is situated on your computer. For this you click the folder icon next to the Folder bar (see Image 2), which will open a pop-up where you can direct your computer to where you have stored the OpenITI folder. This should be a familiar procedure if you have ever opened a file from within a text editor like Word or added an attachment to an email&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2022-02-09/gowaart_van_den_bossche/media/image4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2022-02-09/gowaart_van_den_bossche/media/image4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image 2: Second step of the search in Kate editor – directing Kate to the relevant folder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all! The next step is simply typing your search term or phrase into the 'Find' bar and clicking 'Search'. Kate will then search through all the files contained within the OpenITI folder and list any results which you can then review individually. Due to the amount of files to search through it will take a few minutes to complete, so a perfect time to go and make yourself a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kate will list all results, ordered alphabetically (which means chronologically due to how we name files in the corpus). It is possible to copy these results and paste them in a separate document: this will copy the filepath and the line number as well as the place where the result is found, but the results will not be clickable. In EditPad Pro you can do the same, but the result will be clickable. Once the results are displayed (see Image 3), you can click on one of the results and Kate will open the file and take you to the place where the search result is found in the text by highlighting it. As with Shamela, the search via Kate or EditPadPro is not as smart as Google or the passim software we use to detect text reuse. It will not locate words spelt differently than the way you have input it. The inclusion of works digitised by using OCR in newer releases of the corpus, many of which have not yet been closely proofread, as well as the preponderance of typos in texts from online libraries should also be taken into account. It thus remains important to closely check every search result, especially if they come from texts that do not bear the mARkdown tag (although that tag does not necessarily mean a text is entirely reliable or free from typos, only that it has been looked at by at least two different people and its problems/reliability have been assessed). One way to work around this is by using regular expressions (regex), which is useful to learn in general if you are interested in learning some computational skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2022-02-09/gowaart_van_den_bossche/media/image5.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2022-02-09/gowaart_van_den_bossche/media/image5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;searching-for-the-ikhwan-al-safa-in-the-openiti-corpus&quot;&gt;Searching for the Ikhwan al-safa in the OpenITI corpus&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the method, in the following I will show a few results on searching for the phrase 'ikhwan al-safa' in the corpus. Because of the ambiguity of whether or not the digital texts have properly spelt the first and last letters of that phrase with their respective hamzas, I omitted them and told Kate to look instead for 'khwān al-safa' (see image 3). Regex would have helped here to also include cases where the two words are separated: if the space in the search term is replaced with the regular expression [ -؀\r\n]* it will deal with cases where 'ikhwan' and 'al-safaʾ' are separated by a new line, page number, footnote marker and/or milestone number, etc. but not by another Arabic word. (I am grateful to Peter Verkinderen, KITAB’s in-house regex wizard for this advice).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is clear from the search results — and, to be sure, as is well known among scholars — the phrase 'ikhwan al-safaʾ' did not originate with the enigmatic brotherhood that composed the Epistles. They made use of an existing turn of phrase to designate themselves as a brotherhood that saw itself as exceptionally pure and sincere and which strove to create a broader community built around those principles. Some scholars have suggested that the authors of the epistles took the phrase from &lt;em&gt;Kalila wa-Dimna&lt;/em&gt; (notably Ignaz Goldziher), which seems plausible enough given that the epistles refer to &lt;em&gt;Kalila wa-Dimna&lt;/em&gt; repeatedly and reproduce some of its stories. Our search results indicate however that the translator of &lt;em&gt;Kalila wa-Dimna&lt;/em&gt; himself likely made use of a phrase that was already well attested as a poetic trope and that the authors of the epistles may also have been more broadly inspired. In Image 3 I have opened the earliest search result, a &lt;em&gt;diwan&lt;/em&gt; (poetry compilation) of the pre-Islamic poet Aws b. Hajar (he in fact died before the Hijra, year 1 in the OpenITI corpus, but all pre-Islamic authors are filed under that year within OpenITI), which contains a poem in which the phrase is used. In general, results from the earliest centuries need to be interpreted with care as many of these texts are problematic reconstructions. Some of these diwans never even circulated as such in the pre-modern period and are modern compilations. The early transmission history of &lt;em&gt;Kalila wa-Dimna&lt;/em&gt; is also all but straightforward, however, as the work of the AnonymClassic project is showing. Nevertheless, it appears that the phrase had some currency already very early on and that the authors of the epistles may have been inspired not just by &lt;em&gt;Kalila wa-Dimna&lt;/em&gt; but by a relatively broadly circulating metaphoric designation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very early instance of the phrase, which for sure predates the encyclopaedia and likely also &lt;em&gt;Kalila wa-Dimna&lt;/em&gt;, is found in Ibn Hisham’s redaction of Ibn Ishaq’s &lt;em&gt;sira&lt;/em&gt; of the Prophet. Here the phrase is used in a poem attributed to Abu Khurāsh in which the death of one of the fighters at the Battle of Hunayn is lamented (PageV02P474 of the file 0213IbnHisham.SiraNabawiyya.Shamela0023833-ara1.completed). A very similar phrase is found in a poem that has been attributed to ʿAli b. Abi Talib (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I could write much more about the many different results I found, I will in the remainder of this blog continue to focus on a few further poetic usages. Such references are an understudied phenomenon which I believe has great potential for the study of the reception of the Ikhwanian corpus. Coming across one such poetic use initially urged me to conduct this search: on an important 7th/13th century manuscript manuscript of the &lt;em&gt;Rasaʾil ikhwan al-safaʾ&lt;/em&gt; a reader wrote a line of poetry the flyleaf (see Image 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2022-02-09/gowaart_van_den_bossche/media/image3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2022-02-09/gowaart_van_den_bossche/media/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image 4: poetic line on flyleaf of Süleymaniye Kütüphanesi MS Esad Efendi 3638&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this reader helpfully notes, this line is taken from a longer poem included in the diwan of the famous 8th/14th century poet Safi al-Din al-Hillī (for an accessible introduction to his life and work, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://abbasidhistorypodcast.libsyn.com/ep037-dr-kevin-blankinship-on-af-al-dn-al-ill-1278-1349-ce-poetry-in-the-mamluk-era&quot;&gt;this great podcast episode&lt;/a&gt;), a delightful reproach to a friend who had taken offence at something unspecified al-Hilli said or wrote. The poem is not explained or introduced in the diwan but it is fairly easy to understand. Al-Hilli wrote many poems in this genre of &lt;em&gt;ikhwaniyyat&lt;/em&gt; which boomed in the Islamic Middle Period when poetic communication became much more diverse and socially horizontal, rather than predominantly embedded in hierarchical court settings. While the diwan does not give any further info about the recipient of this poem, it does not give the impression of being addressed to a superior either. Here is the full poem with my translation, with obvious references to the Epistles highlighted in bold. The line cited on the manuscript fly leaf is the third line. (I am grateful to Lorenz Nigst and Aslisho Qurboniev for their advice on this translation)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;حَتّامَ أَمنَحُكَ المَوَدَّةَ وَالوَفا      وَتَسومُني قَصدَ القَطيعَةِ وَالجَفا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How I gave friendship and fidelity to you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-nowrap&quot;&gt;    only to have you impose estrangement and aversion on me
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;يا عاتِباً لِجَريرَةٍ لَم أَجِنها      ظَنّاً بِأَنَّ وَفايَ كانَ تَكَلُّفا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You censured an offence that I did not commit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-nowrap&quot;&gt;    as if you thought my fidelity was but pretension
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;بِاللَهِ لِم ثَقُلَت عَليكَ رَسائِلي      هَذا وَأَنتَ أَجَلُّ إِخوانِ الصَفا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By God, why do my letters weigh on you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-nowrap&quot;&gt;    even though you are the loftiest of the Sincere Brethren?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَلِمَ اِطَّلَعتَ عَلى جِبالِ مَوَدَّتي      فَجَعَلتَها بِالهَجرِ قاعاً صَفصَفا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did you ascend the mountains of my love&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-nowrap&quot;&gt;    only to make them into a barren wasteland by abandoning them soon after?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;هَب أَنَّني أَغلَظتُ قَولي عاتِباً      أَيَجوزُ أَن يُقلى الصَديقُ إِذا هَفا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that I spoke rudely when I scolded you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-nowrap&quot;&gt;    does that mean a friend’s lapse gives permission to detest him?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;إِنَّ الصَديقَ إِذا تَأَكَّدَ حَقُّهُ      بِالوُدِّ أَغلَظَ في العِتابِ وَعَنَّفا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the friend, if convinced of his right,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-nowrap&quot;&gt;    will speak coarsely and vehemently in censuring out of affection
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;وَكَذا سَميعُ العَتبِ في حالِ الرِضى   يُغضي لَهُ وَإِذا تَحَرَّفَ حَرَّفا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just so, he who contentedly hears the censure,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-nowrap&quot;&gt;    will condone it, even if it is extremely harsh
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;كَالراحِ تُدعى الإِثمَ عِندَ مَلالِها      وَمَعَ الرِضى تُدعى السُلافَ القَرقَفا&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as wine is called 'sin' (&lt;em&gt;ithm&lt;/em&gt;) when people grow weary of it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-nowrap&quot;&gt;    and a 'vintage' (&lt;em&gt;sulaf&lt;/em&gt;) or 'frisson' &lt;em&gt;(qarqaf&lt;/em&gt;) when it brings pleasure
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that al-Hilli does not just use the phrase &lt;em&gt;ikhwan al-safaʾ&lt;/em&gt; here, but also &lt;em&gt;rasaʾili&lt;/em&gt; to refer to his own letters leaves little doubt that he is here not just evoking a time-worn turn of phrase, but also a text that had by his lifetime become very popular. As my ongoing research into the manuscript tradition of the &lt;em&gt;Rasaʾil ikhwan al-safa&lt;/em&gt; indicates, production notably boomed in the 7th/13th century and most prominently in the Ilkhanid realm and sphere of influence where al-Hilli spent a good part of his life. Furthermore, in the first line he uses the word 'al-wafa', which is found in the longer title of the epistles: &lt;em&gt;Rasaʾil ikhwan al-safaʾ wa-khullan (&lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;khillan&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;em&gt;al-wafaʾ&lt;/em&gt;. Another search I did for the latter phrase in the corpus indicates that this was much less widely used, and that when it was, it tended to refer unambiguously to the Epistles. However, note that the last word in the line referring to &lt;em&gt;ikhwan al-safaʾ&lt;/em&gt; is written defectively as &lt;em&gt;safa&lt;/em&gt; (that is, without the final &lt;em&gt;hamza&lt;/em&gt;) and thus may refer to the hill of Safa in Mecca. Although I think it is more of a case of poetic licence here, some of the usage I came across in other search results does indicate this second meaning, and al-Hilli is possibly deliberately courting ambiguity here. Indeed, in the fourth line of this poem he also refers to the 'mountains of my love' (&lt;em&gt;jibal mawaddati&lt;/em&gt;). This may refer to an exceptionally beautiful poem attributed to ʿAli b. Abi Talib (transmitted amongst others by Ibn ʿAsakir) where he refers to the love amongst the Brethren of Safa whose friendship 'we engraved on the sky with pens of fine dust' &lt;em&gt;(naqashna wudd ikhwan al-Safa // bi-aqlam al-habaʾ ʿala al-hawaʾ&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, our poem is also not the only one referencing the &lt;em&gt;ikhwan&lt;/em&gt; in al-Hilli’s diwan. He does so again, and much less ambiguously, in the first line of a longer 23-line poem inviting a friend to his house in Mardin (this time the topic is introduced in the diwan), where he writes all the &lt;em&gt;hamza&lt;/em&gt;s and also uses the phrase &lt;em&gt;khillan al-wafaʾ&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;رسائل صدق إخوان الصفاء      تجدد أنس خلان الوفاء&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincere brethren’s truthful writings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;text-nowrap&quot;&gt;   renew the intimacy between faithful friends
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is but a very small sampling of the 1694 matches for our phrase identified by Kate in the OpenITI corpus (see Image 3 — however, note that probably at least half of these are duplicates, usages found in two or more different versions of the same text), but it highlights that poetic references to the Ikhwan al-Safaʾ constitute a potentially rich field of enquiry for which this simple search method may be used fruitfully. The existence of a number of versifications of Epistles from the Ikhwanian corpus as well as poems responding to the Epistles’ contents recorded on flyleaves and title pages, which I have come across in my study of the Ikhwanian manuscript tradition suggests that this could figure in a broader evaluation of the literary reception of the Epistles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In EditPad Pro: Use Ctrl+F to open the search-and-replace box, and write your search term in the Search field. In the EditPad Pro menu, go to Search &amp;gt; Find on Disk; this will open a dialog box where you can select the folder you want to search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image 5: Search on Disk dialog in EditPad Pro. Pro tip: write `\^[01].+(?&amp;lt;!yml)$` in the Regular expression field, after ticking the ‘regular expression’ box: this way, only text files will be searched, and not metadata or other irrelevant files. (Note, this also works in Kate)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you click the OK button, EditPad Pro will start searching all files and subfolders within that folder. The search results will finally be displayed in a separate window. You can preview the lines that contain the matches inside the search results window; if you double-click on the line number, the text will open in the editor at that location.&lt;/p&gt;

Within the KITAB project we spend the bulk of our time fine-tuning the methods of text reuse and the data it provides on the corpus’ many textual relationships, but we are aware that this is not necessarily the primary interest in digital texts for many scholars. As the continued popularity of the Shamela library and its software suggests, one of the most important functions of a corpus of digital texts is its searchability: scholars want to be able to search for information and locate the usage of names, words and phrases across a vast corpus. In the long run we hope to develop a complex search app by which users will be able to search the OpenITI corpus online, but our colleague Aslisho Qurboniev discovered that doing so is in fact already possible with both of the two text editors we recommend to read texts from the corpus: EditPad Pro and Kate. This is a great and easy method to do searches and it is more reliable than using Shamela. For guidance on installing these editors and the mARkdown highlighting scheme, see here. (Installing the highlighting scheme is not absolutely necessary for simply searching the corpus, but it is nice to be able to fold texts and see the structural tagging to help navigation.)</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/images/blogs/2022-02-09/gowaart_van_den_bossche/media/image6.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/images/blogs/2022-02-09/gowaart_van_den_bossche/media/image6.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">New KITAB visualizations</title><link href="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/New-KITAB-visualizations/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New KITAB visualizations" /><published>2021-12-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://kitab-project-org.github.io/New-KITAB-visualizations</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/New-KITAB-visualizations/">&lt;p&gt;Much of our work at KITAB involves comparing books in order to understand their relationships. Our main tool for this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitab-project.org/methods/text-reuse&quot;&gt;passim&lt;/a&gt; software, which detects passages two texts have in common (here are some of our blogs about passim: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitab-project.org/Dispatches-from-al-Tabari-7-Text-Reuse/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitab-project.org/a/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitab-project.org/Adventures-in-Alignments-Training-an-Algorithm-to-Recognise-Text-Reuse/&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitab-project.org/A-Tale-of-3-Versions/&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). passim produces a lot of data about each pair of passages, including where exactly in both books these passages are found, and how many words and characters the shared passage contains in either book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each pair of books, this data is collected in a csv file, which can be loaded into a spreadsheet. In this form, the data is not very human-reader-friendly. In order for us to get an understanding of what all these rows and rows of data mean for the relationship between two books, we use visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common visualization we use to visualize the overall relation between two books, and which is familiar to anyone who has ever read a blog post or attended a lecture on the KITAB project, is what we have started to call our 'scroll' visualization (see Figure 1) - that is scroll in the old-fashioned sense of a rolled-up strip of paper, not the digital-age thing you do with a mouse or on your phone. The team has also been referring to this visualization as the “pairwise visualization”, because it is the visualization we most commonly use to compare pairs of books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1: scroll visualization of the text reuse between al-Istakhri’s&lt;/em&gt; Kitab al-Masalik wa-al-mamalik &lt;em&gt;(top) and Ibn Hawqal’s&lt;/em&gt; Kitab Surat al-ard &lt;em&gt;(bottom).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how you read this visualization (see Figure 2): imagine that we write out the text of both books we compared on a very large scroll, 300 words per line. We then highlight passages that are in both scrolls in red, and connect the location of the passage in scroll 1 to that in scroll 2 with a yellow line (we considered briefly calling this visualization our 'spaghetti' visualization after these yellow lines). Finally, we zoom out so far that we can only see the highlighted passages and the connecting lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2: How to interpret a scroll visualization.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The red lines give us an impression of how much of the book is reused in the other book, while the yellow lines help us see whether the common passages occur in the same order in both books. In the example in Figures 1 and 2, the red lines show that much of al-Istakhri’s work is reused in Ibn Hawqal’s, and the absence of red lines in some sections of the book shows that Ibn Hawqal did not reuse some sections but added his own information there. (People who know the books will immediately suspect that the large blank section in the first quarter of Ibn Hawqal’s book must be his description of the Maghrib, which is entirely independent from al-Istakhri’s). Meanwhile, the fact that the yellow lines all run nicely parallel shows us that Ibn Hawqal faithfully followed the structure of al-Istakhri’s book. For examples where this is not the case, see Sarah Savant’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitab-project.org/A-Tale-of-3-Versions/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; on the different versions of Malik’s al-Muwatta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kitab-diffviewer&quot;&gt;KITAB DiffViewer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scroll visualization is very useful for comparing books at a high level. For fine-grained comparisons of the differences and similarities between passages identified by passim as text reuse, we until recently used an online tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diffchecker.com/&quot;&gt;Diffchecker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3: Diffchecker visualization of a passage from Muntajab al-Din’s&lt;/em&gt; Fihrist &lt;em&gt;(left) and Agha Buzurg Tihrani’s&lt;/em&gt; Dhariʿa &lt;em&gt;(right). Differences are highlighted in darker shade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool highlights words that are different between two passages in a darker shade, but it does not do a very good job with Arabic texts: it does not display right-to-left text correctly, and it cannot deal well with the small differences between tokens caused by prefixes and suffixes. From looking only at the coloured areas, not the text, in the example in Figure 3, we get the impression that there are only two short sections in the passage that are similar in both texts. However, when we look closer at the text, we can see that already the first word is highlighted as different, although it is exactly the same, albeit that the Dhariʿa (the text on the right) adds the suffix &lt;em&gt;-hu&lt;/em&gt; at the end of the word (تصانيف vs تصانيفه). Similarly, the third word in the &lt;em&gt;Fihrist&lt;/em&gt; is identical to the second word in the &lt;em&gt;Dhariʿa&lt;/em&gt;, except for a dot on the last letter (نقص vs نقض).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to blame the tool for this: like many similar tools, it was mostly designed to detect changes in computer code. Such a comparison between two versions of the same code is called a 'diff' in computer speak - hence the tool’s name 'diffchecker'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked into many other online diff tools, hoping to find one that would work better for our texts. Unfortunately, all tools I checked had the same problem. The most promising one seemed to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cacycle/diff&quot;&gt;wikEd-diff&lt;/a&gt;, a program written to detect and highlight edits in wikipedia articles (see Figure 4). Designed to work with prose written in human languages rather than computer code in mind, it does a better job at catching differences and similarities between two passages of Arabic text, even at a sub-word level. Moreover, it is the only tool I found that can detect blocks of text that were moved rather than added or deleted. Contrary to Diffchecker and other similar tools, however, it displays the two fragments in a single composite (Frankenstein-like) text, with different colours for text that is present only in fragment 1 or fragment 2 (see Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4: wikEd-diff visualization of the same two passages as Figure 3, generated with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cacycle.altervista.org/wikEd-diff-tool.html&quot;&gt;wikEd-diff online demo tool&lt;/a&gt;. Text that is only in fragment 1 (from Muntajab al-Din’s&lt;/em&gt; Fihrist &lt;em&gt;) is highlighted in blue, text that is only in fragment 2 (from Agha Buzurg Tihrani’s&lt;/em&gt; Dhariʿa &lt;em&gt;) in orange. Text that is present in both fragments but in a different location is placed where it appears in fragment 2 and highlighted in grey; at its location in fragment 1, an arrow is inserted, and when you hover over the arrow with the mouse, the corresponding text in the other fragment is highlighted in a darker grey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not easy to read: the display looks cluttered and although the tool selected more text as common to both fragments than Diffchecker, the fact that both alternatives are displayed in the same composite text gives the impression there is much more difference than similarity between the two text fragments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After giving up hope for an out-of-the-box solution, I started searching for javascript or Python libraries that can be used for analysing and displaying the difference between two strings of text, and which I could use to build a diff tool for our OpenITI texts myself. Again, there are plenty of those (I tried &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/diffchecker&quot;&gt;diffchecker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/prettydiff/prettydiff/&quot;&gt;prettydiff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mergely.com/doc&quot;&gt;mergely&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rtfpessoa/diff2html&quot;&gt;diff2html&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff&quot;&gt;jsdiff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch&quot;&gt;diff-match-patch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/liddiard/text-diff&quot;&gt;text-diff&lt;/a&gt;) but almost all of them are focussed on displaying diffs between two versions of the same program code, rather than prose texts in human languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the best option seemed to be to use the wikEd-diff javascript code to analyse the differences and similarities between the two passages and then to parse and manipulate its html output in order to display both passages in separate fields rather than as one composite text (Figure 5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image5.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5: wikEd-diff output, refined and split into two separate texts (colour coding: blue: only in fragment 1; green: only in fragment 2; orange: in both fragments but in different positions).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wrote a script to refine the output of the wikEd-diff code to make it handle differences below the word/token level in a better way. Compare, for example, how wikEd-diff marks the first word in the example strings, تصايف / تصانيفه (&lt;em&gt;tasanif / tasanif-hu&lt;/em&gt;), as entirely different (Figure 4), and how the refined output (Figure 5) marks only the suffix &lt;em&gt;-hu&lt;/em&gt; as different. In the appendix, I will go into a bit more technical detail on how this was done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result is that the commonalities between the two texts are much clearer with the OpenITI Diff Viewer than with diffchecker or the raw wikEd-diff output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have embedded this code in an online app that is publicly available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitab-project.org/diffViewer/&quot;&gt;https://kitab-project.org/diffViewer/&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image6.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 6: OpenITI Diff Viewer interface after loading two texts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app was optimized for use with our OpenITI texts: for example, by default, all OpenITI mARkdown tags (and all punctuation) are stripped away, and all alif-hamza combinations, ta’ marbutas/final ha’s and alif maqsuras/final ya's are normalized. These settings are optional, however, and can be (de)selected in the Options field (see Figure 7).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image7.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 7: Diff Viewer options&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app has more options: the most useful,in my opinion, is that you can divide the output into lines to make it easier to read the passages side by side (Figure 8). It is usually easy enough to read the beginning of an alignment, but after a couple of lines, it becomes hard to follow where you are in the other fragment, especially if there are many additions/deletions on both sides. This option makes sure that after a divergence between both fragments, both start on the same new line from the point onwards where they converge again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image8.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 8: splitting the output into lines for easier reading (compare to Figure 6!).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can download the diff as an image file by clicking the ‘Download png’ or ‘Download svg’ buttons. Before downloading the image, you can resize the text fields by dragging the right-most margin of the image, and change the font size in ‘Options’, so that it fits the layout of the publication you want to use it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, we would also like to provide an option by which you can create a permalink to your diff output, which you can then link to in a publication. This has not yet been implemented, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reuse-heat-map&quot;&gt;Reuse heat map&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, we would sometimes like to be able to visualize all reuse one text has in common with all other texts in the corpus (or a selection).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way I came up with to do this is to use a heat map: a visualization that indicates by the use of colours how intensely each part of a text has been reused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image9.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image9.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 9: heat map of the reuse of al-Tabari’s&lt;/em&gt; Tarikh &lt;em&gt;. The number of times each character in the text features in a reuse alignment detected by passim is indicated by colours (see the colour scale on the right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the heat map of text reuse of al-Tabari’s &lt;em&gt;Tarikh&lt;/em&gt; (Figure 9). The visualization works in a similar way to the book-to-book scroll visualization (Figure 2): the graph represents a scroll, in which each line represents 300 words. Whereas the book-to-book visualization highlights all passages both books have in common in red, this visualization highlights each character in a colour that reflects the number of times it appears in an alignment with another text in the corpus, as detected by passim: in the example in Figure 9, any sections marked in light yellow feature less than 10 times in a reuse instance, while those marked in dark purple were reused up to 120 times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows us to see that not all parts of the texts were as intensively reused as others: there is a clear concentration of darker (more reused) passages between (roughly) lines 700 and 1200. We can go back to the text to find out which section is so much more intensively reused than the other sections of the work: each 300-word section that is represented by a line in the scroll is marked in OpenITI texts with a numbered 'milestone' tag within the text (for example, the end of the first 300-word chunk in the text is marked with the tag `ms001`). Using these milestone numbers, we can see the intensively reused section in the heatmap agrees with the section on the life of the Prophet Muḥammad: the section titled &lt;em&gt;al-qawl fi al-sira al-nabawiyya&lt;/em&gt; starts in the milestone 685, while the section on Muḥammad’s death ends in al-Ṭabarī’s text in milestone 1176.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heat maps can also be used to investigate the spread of reuse over time. One useful application is to split the text reuse into reuse of earlier and later works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image10.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image10.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 10: text reuse of al-Tabari’s&lt;/em&gt; Tarikh &lt;em&gt;in books written by authors who died before and after al-Tabari.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 10 clearly shows that the material al-Tabari used for his &lt;em&gt;Tarikh&lt;/em&gt; is only partially known from older sources in the corpus: especially the sections between the death of the Prophet and the start of the Umayyad period, and the later ʿAbbāsid period are sparsely documented. Of course, this does not mean that al-Ṭabarī uses original material here; rather, that the material he used did not make it into the corpus. Especially interesting in this sense is the tight-knit block of reuse just between lines 4100 and 4200: when we look at where this reuse comes from, we can see that it comes from the only extant part of Ibn Abi Tahir Tayfur’s &lt;em&gt;Kitab Baghdad&lt;/em&gt;. It is therefore very likely that if the rest of that book were extant, passim would detect much more reuse for the Abbasid part of the &lt;em&gt;Tarikh&lt;/em&gt;. Sarah Savant&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; has argued for al-Tabari’s heavy reuse of Ibn Abi Tahir’s text (without mentioning the author) based on an analysis of al-Tabari’s citation patterns in the Tarikh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also split up the reuse data of the later sources into smaller periods, to see whether the reuse is more or less evenly spread over time. For example, if we split up the reuse of Tabari’s &lt;em&gt;Tarikh&lt;/em&gt; in later texts into 200-year periods (Figure 11), we see that the section on the life of Muhammad consistently remains the heaviest reused section, but that the later parts of the work lose their importance after the 10th hijri century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image11.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image11.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 11: Reuse of al-Tabari’s&lt;/em&gt; Tarikh &lt;em&gt;in later texts, grouped by 200-year periods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This visualization is generated using a Python script; the heatmaps it outputs are interactive (you can zoom in, and get a count of the number of times a specific word is reused when you move your mouse over a coloured bar; it could also show the URIs of all texts that reuse those specific words). See an example &lt;a href=&quot;/tabari-heat-map&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming months, we will build a publicly available online app to build such heatmaps, to be released when the KITAB data becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;appendix&quot;&gt;Appendix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wikEd-diff code is an implementation of an algorithm consisting of six steps, first described by Paul Heckel in his 1978 article ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://documents.scribd.com/docs/10ro9oowpo1h81pgh1as.pdf&quot;&gt;A Technique for Isolating Differences Between Files&lt;/a&gt;’. The algorithm tries to find the most likely steps by which one string (s1) was turned into another string (s2) by three different types of actions: insertion, deletion, moving. The idea is simple: both strings (s1 and s2) are split into tokens, and tokens that appear exactly once in each string are used as anchors. Next, the tokens before and after those anchors are compared in a number of further steps. The end result is that each token in s2 is marked as either common to both strings, or inserted / deleted / moved to another position in s2 as compared to s1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WikEd-diff code outputs a single html string in which the inserted, deleted and moved characters are enclosed in span tags with different classes for each type (see Figure 5):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;inserts: `class=&quot;wikEdDiffInsert&quot;`&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;deletions: `class=&quot;wikEdDiffDelete&quot;`&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;moves: characters in s2 are in a span with `class=&quot;wikEdDiffBlock&quot;`, while the position of these characters in s1 is marked with a placeholder character in a span with class `wikEdDiffMarkRight` or `wikEdDiffMarkLeft` (depending on whether the text was moved to the left or right in s2)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters that both strings have in common are included as plain text (without tags).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image12.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image12.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 12: Simplified and abbreviated extract of the output of the wikEd-diff code. Spans are highlighted in the same colours as in Figure 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a script that splits this composite html text into two separate html strings (output1 and output2) in order to display them side by side: untagged (shared) text is added to both output strings, `wikEdDiffInsert` and `wikEdDiffBlock` spans only to output2, `wikEdDiffDelete` and `wikEdDiffMarkRight`/`wikEdDiffMarkLeft` spans only to output1 (Figure 13).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image13.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image13.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 13: wikEd-diff output split into two separate texts (blue: only in s1, green: only in s2, orange: in s1 and s2 but in different positions). Generated from the wikEd-diff output in Figure 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works, but I noticed that the output of the wikEd-diff code is not as fine-grained as we’d like: more often than not, it will tag an entire word as insertion/deletion even if the only difference is a prefix or a suffix, or a single character. For example, in the first line of Figures 4, 12 and 13, you can see that like diffchecker, wikEd-diff marks تصايف / تصانيفه (&lt;em&gt;tasanif / tasanif-hu&lt;/em&gt;) as entirely different tokens, although they differ only by one character. The same goes for the words نقص / نقض and التصفح / التصفيح on the same line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image5.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 14: wikEd-diff output split into two separate texts (blue: only in s1, green: only in s2, orange: in s1 and s2 but in different positions) and refined using shingled 3-grams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a next step, I wrote my own implementation of (the first five steps) in Heckel’s algorithm in order to finetune the output of the script: each text inside a span is divided into shingled n-grams (default: n = 3 characters; this can be changed under “Options” in the app, see Figure 5), and then these n-grams are used as tokens for Heckel’s algorithm. This significantly improves the output: for example, in the first line of Figure 14, you can see that the refined output correctly identifies the word تصانيف as shared between both strings, with only the suffix &lt;em&gt;-hu&lt;/em&gt; ه tagged as addition in string 2. Similarly, only the last letter in نقص / نقض is tagged as different in both strings.&lt;/p&gt;

Our main tool for this is the passim software, which detects passages two texts have in common (here are some of our blogs about passim: 1, 2, 3, 4). passim produces a lot of data about each pair of passages, including where exactly in both books these passages are found, and how many words and characters the shared passage contains in either book.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image10.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/images/blogs/2021-12-03/peter_verkinderen/media/image10.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Some Suggestions on Using OpenITI Corpus to Present Enhanced Digital Versions of Large Collections: The Case of al-Dhari‘a Ila Tasanif al-Shi‘a</title><link href="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/Some-Suggestions-on-Using-OpenITI-Corpus/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Some Suggestions on Using OpenITI Corpus to Present Enhanced Digital Versions of Large Collections: The Case of al-Dhari‘a Ila Tasanif al-Shi‘a" /><published>2021-11-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-11-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://kitab-project-org.github.io/Some-Suggestions-on-Using-OpenITI-Corpus</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/Some-Suggestions-on-Using-OpenITI-Corpus/">&lt;p&gt;Tagging the structure of the texts in OpenITI corpus is an important step towards the ultimate goal of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitab-project.org/&quot;&gt;KITAB project&lt;/a&gt;—Studying the Arabic textual tradition using text reuse detection (for a detailed description of the tagging process, see my other blog post &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitab-project.org/Tagging-the-Structure-of-Texts-in-the-OPENITI-Corpus/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). However, its application goes much beyond the aims set for this project. In the first place, it creates a corpus of manually-tagged texts, annotated by human annotators and reviewed by second annotators, to which readers have access, with an interactive space enabling them to suggest corrections for any problem in the tags or in any part of the text itself through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenITI/Annotation/issues&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; reporting mechanism on our GitHub page. Besides, with a touch of creativity, such a corpus developed by spending so much time on preparing each single text can be freely used as a base by specialists who decide to work on specific texts in their area of specialty. In this blog post, I will try to explain how our annotated texts can be used to present enhanced versions of the texts, especially large biographical/bibliographical collections. By enhanced version, I mean a digital (and preferably online) version modified in order to facilitate using the content of the text for readers and also facilitate doing research on the text (or even more broadly on the genre of the text) for specialists. The text I will use here as an example is the famous Shiʿi bibliographical collection &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenITI/1400AH/tree/master/data/1389AghaBuzurgTihrani/1389AghaBuzurgTihrani.DharicaIlaTasanifShica&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;al-Dhari’a ila tasanif al-shi’a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, the suggestions and methods presented here are by no means limited to this text and can be applied to any other tagged bibliographical/biographical text on our corpus. To show how our tagged texts can be used for this purpose, first I will briefly explain what I, as the annotator, have done on it and will make some preliminary suggestions to improve the quality of the text; then I will show a few possibilities for the corpus which can be helpful for a wider audience interested in the text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Al-Dhari’a&lt;/em&gt; is the largest bibliographical collection indexing the Shiʿi written tradition in Arabic and Persian (and occasionally Turkish and Urdu) in 29 printed volumes and around 55000 entries, compiled by &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_7548&quot;&gt;Agha Buzurg al-Tihrani&lt;/a&gt; (1293/1876-1389/1970) in a span of 60 years searching through around 60 libraries in several countries from Iran and Iraq to Syria and Egypt (find the PDF &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/alzariah&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The text has a very clear structure with numbered entries which are the titles of the texts (manuscripts or published) sorted alphabetically according to the first letter. There are also cross-references which are not numbered. So, as the first step, I tagged all the entries as simple entries (### $), and cross-references with an asterisk (### $ *), and then I checked the sequentiality of the numbered entries through a Python script. Hundreds of numbers were typed incorrectly in our digital version, which I corrected manually. Entries that did not have a number or had duplicate numbers in the printed edition, I tagged with a ### $ + (see Figure 1) (however, it is not known whether such numbering problems should be attributed to the original manuscript or to the typists of the printed edition). In an enhanced digital version, the cross-references would be linked to their main entries, and a secondary numbering system could be set up to correct the incorrect numbers in the printed edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-11-22/hamid_reza_hakimi/media/image1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-11-22/hamid_reza_hakimi/media/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Screenshot of the folded text to show only the headers in EditPad Pro: a cross-reference tagged as ### $ * and two duplicate numbers tagged as ### $ +.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The categorisation of the headers should also be modified in an enhanced version. The entries are sorted according to their first alphabetical letter. So, the first-level headers (tagged with one pipe: ### |) are successive alphabetical letters. Occasionally, the author has introduced second-level headers (tagged with two pipes: ### ||) to group texts that have the first word of the title in common, or belong to a specific genre. Since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alraqmiyyat.github.io/mARkdown/&quot;&gt;OpenITI mARkdown annotation system&lt;/a&gt; does not include closing tags, I used blank second-level headers to mark the end of these sections (Figure 2). Appropriate headers can be added in square brackets for all of such sub-categories to facilitate navigation. The other problem in the categorisation of the headers is that in the fourth volume (and in a very few cases in other volumes), after the first-level alphabetical headers, there is an additional layer of headers based on the second alphabetical letter of the entries, which has made the levelling of the whole text inconsistent (see Figure 3). In an improved version, the text could be made more accessible by extending this secondary level based on the second letter to the navigation of the entire text (in a way that makes clear this is done by the annotator, not by the author). So, the first-level headers will be the first alphabetical letter of the entries; the second-level headers will be the second alphabetical letter of the entries; and the third-level headers will be the genre or the first word of the title of the books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-11-22/hamid_reza_hakimi/media/image2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-11-22/hamid_reza_hakimi/media/image2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Screenshot of the folded text to show only the headers in EditPad Pro: an additional layer of categorisation applied occasionally in the fourth volume based on the second alphabetical letter of the entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major issue in most large collections that needs to be dealt with is its appendices or supplements, compiled by the original author or by subsequent writers. In this case, the last volume of the text is an appendix compiled by the original author alphabetically indexing the texts he has found after publishing his book. Besides, the text has several supplements compiled by subsequent authors to complement the entries. An enhanced digital version offers the possibility to add links to these supplements. The entries indexed in the author’s appendix and the ones indexed in the supplements could be integrated into the text using abbreviations showing from which text each entry is drawn. I have created a sample in Figure 4 in which ABT-SUP stands for the entries taken from the author’s supplement; MAR stands for the entries taken from a contemporary supplement written by Muhammad Ali al-Rawadati entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://ebookshia.com/books/view/1106/%D8%AA%DA%A9%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A9+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B9%D8%A9+%D8%A7%D9%84%DB%8C+%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%D9%81+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%DB%8C%D8%B9%D8%A9+%28%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%AF+1%29&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Takmilat&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;al-Dhari’a ila tasanif al-Shi’a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; and MTB stands for the entries taken from another contemporary supplement written by Muhammad al-Tabataba’i al-Bihbahani entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://noorlib.ir/book/view/18065?viewType=pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;al-Shari’a ila istidrak al-Dhari’a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apart from the entries of the supplements, some of the entries indexed in the original text could also be linked to their correct places. The author introduces new texts that should have been mentioned in previous volumes after the phrase ‘قد فاتنا ذكره في محله’. For all such cases, links could be added to the relevant places in previous volumes. I showed one case in the figure with ABT-M which stands for Agha Buzurg al-Tihrani matn. Such an abbreviation system will make a digital version in which the readers have access to all the entries both in the original text and in the supplements in a successive order, while at the same time, the entries belong to each specific text is clearly recognisable, with the ability of adding the entries in newly-found or newly-compiled supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-11-22/hamid_reza_hakimi/media/image4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-11-22/hamid_reza_hakimi/media/image4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4&lt;/strong&gt;: A sample integrating three entries from the supplements plus one from the original text placed in its correct position. The first number is the successive number for all entries. The second one which is in parenthesis shows that the number either belongs to the original text, or is added (by a plus sign) from a supplement. The abbreviation and the following PAGE/NO shows the page number and the entry number of the supplement from which the entry is drawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;named-entities&quot;&gt;Named Entities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preparing the text’s indexes (list of the names of people, places, etc.) will be greatly facilitated through this tagging method. Since Arabic keyboards are not uniform and often use different Unicode codes for the same letters, the first step in preparing indexes is to homogenise the letters (this is required since many of the large texts are typed by several typists, or produced by joining sections from different sources). The next step is tagging the names inside the text through a combination of automatic tagging and human annotation (Ideally, tagging the information inside the texts will be part of the project’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://maximromanov.github.io/mARkdown/&quot;&gt;analytical annotation&lt;/a&gt; phase which should be done according to individual researchers’ objectives. However, given the limitations in resources, this may take years). The text in question here, for example, is much more than a bibliographical collection, and in many cases, presents very useful information about the authors of the entries, or sometimes even the scribes of the manuscripts of the entries. Besides, the name of an author may be repeated several times in the text. So, the name of each person should have an in-text link showing in a pop-up window all the other places where that name appears in the text. This would allow the readers to have quick access to all the books written by each author and also his biographical information in case it is available in the text (the indexes that have been prepared for texts, sometimes published separately, can be used as a base here. See an index of names for &lt;em&gt;al-Dhari’a&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://noorlib.ir/book/view/18064?viewType=pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for example). If the author is well-known, a link to EI2, EI3 or any other modern encyclopedia, or name authority files (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://viaf.org/&quot;&gt;VIAF&lt;/a&gt;) can complement the collection of the links in the pop-up window; otherwise, the links will be a good starting point for collecting information about less well-known authors or even the scribes. Besides, tagging other names in the text will also provide a great opportunity for scholars who will work on different aspects of the text. As an example, in many cases, the author mentions the names of the libraries in which he has found the books he introduces. Tagging the names of the libraries will enable the scholars interested in the history of libraries in Islamic world to reconstruct the lost stock of the libraries to some extent. Furthermore, the entries that have been published up to now can be linked to their respective items in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldcat.org/&quot;&gt;WorldCat&lt;/a&gt; database. This will allow us to have a list of the books that are lost, or are extant but have not been published yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;text-reuse-data&quot;&gt;Text Reuse Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KITAB team’s text reuse data could enrich an enhanced digital version. The team uses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dasmiq/passim&quot;&gt;passim&lt;/a&gt; algorithm to compare all texts in the corpus with each other and find instances where a pair of texts have passages in common. This data could be used to find out which parts of the text are drawn from previous texts and which parts are repeated in subsequent texts—a process which not only helps in any research about the text, but also in editing the text or reconstructing its lost sections (see Figure 6). Since large texts are more likely to extensively quote previous sources and be quoted in later sources, running passim on them will most probably bring very helpful results (for a general description of passim see &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitab-project.org/methods/text-reuse&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There are some other blog posts on our website about it: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitab-project.org/a/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitab-project.org/Adventures-in-Alignments-Training-an-Algorithm-to-Recognise-Text-Reuse/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitab-project.org/Algorithmic-Reading-of-Shi%CA%BFi-Hadith-Collections-Direct-Borrowing-and-Common-Sources/&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitab-project.org/On-Commentaries,-Digressions,-Transtextualities,-and-Rabbit-Holes/&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passim can also be run on a pair of texts to find similar passages. Figure 8 is the result of passim on the pair &lt;em&gt;al-Dhari’a&lt;/em&gt; and Muntajab al-Din Ibn Babawayh’s &lt;em&gt;al-Fihrist&lt;/em&gt;, another Shiʿi bibliography written in the 6^th^/12^th^ century, showing which parts of &lt;em&gt;al-Dhari’a&lt;/em&gt; are likely to be drawn from this text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-11-22/hamid_reza_hakimi/media/image10.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-11-22/hamid_reza_hakimi/media/image10.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 9&lt;/strong&gt;: Graphical representation of the information in Figure 8, showing the distribution of the reused passages of &lt;em&gt;al-Fihrist&lt;/em&gt; (on the bottom) in &lt;em&gt;al-Dhari’a&lt;/em&gt; (on the top). As it is evident, the cases of reuse are very sparse in comparison with the texts at the top of the table in Figure 6. However, for a detailed analysis of the text, they could still be of importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finding similar passages in a pair of texts, it will also be possible to observe the differences between them using our text-comparing app &lt;a href=&quot;https://pverkind.github.io/OpenITIdiffViewer/&quot;&gt;OpenITI Diff viewer&lt;/a&gt; (see Figure 10). The app can also be used for a second function. The OpenITI corpus contains different digital versions of the same texts —sometimes different digitisations of the same paper edition, and sometimes of different printed editions. Thus, most folders contain more than one edition of the text (this is not the case about &lt;em&gt;al-Dhari’a&lt;/em&gt; which is a recent compilation most of which was published while the author was still alive). So, the app also enables specialist scholars (those who intend to present a newer edition of the text, for example) to compare different printed editions and easily observe the differences between them. This will save a lot of time and energy that close reading of the texts for comparison would require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-11-22/hamid_reza_hakimi/media/image11.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-11-22/hamid_reza_hakimi/media/image11.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last of all, let me emphasise again that the issues considered here are the most typical issues that can be enhanced in the digital versions of all large biographical/bibliographical texts. For an enhanced version, almost all such texts have a numbering system that need to be corrected; have categorised headers (usually alphabetical) that should be revised; have some supplements, written either by the original author or by the subsequent authors, that need to be integrated into the text (many of the supplements are also available on our corpus and are ready to be used for this purpose); need indexes and in-text links that are vital for mining the information inside the text (which can be prepared by tagging the necessary items inside the text by specialists); need to be collated with other editions through digital methods; and need to be set against preceding and following texts to discover which parts of their information is abstracted from previous sources and which parts are reproduced in subsequent texts. The tagged texts in OpenITI corpus, although not necessarily aimed at resolving all of the mentioned issues, provide an unequalled facility which paves the way for scholars and specialists in the field to deal with each one of them. Highly ambitious projects might go far beyond this. In this case, for example, it would not be far-fetched for a team of specialist researchers and editors to embark upon performing the same process on other Shiʿi bibliographical collections on the corpus, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenITI/0475AH/tree/master/data/0460ShaykhTusi/0460ShaykhTusi.Fihrist&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;al-Fihrist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Shaykh Tusi (d. 460) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenITI/0575AH/tree/master/data/0575IbnBabawayh/0575IbnBabawayh.Fihrist&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;al-Fihrist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Muntajab al-Din (d. 575), aiming finally at creating the most comprehensive Shiʿi bibliography by joining all the collections together. The whole point is that the same process can be carried out on any other biographical/bibliographical collection (or set of collections) in the corpus in any given field.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Hamid Reza Hakimi</name></author><category term="" /><category term="" /><category term="viz" /><category term="markdown" /><category term="corpus" /><summary type="html">Tagging the structure of the texts in OpenITI corpus is an important step towards the ultimate goal of the KITAB project—Studying the Arabic textual tradition using text reuse detection (for a detailed description of the tagging process, see my other blog post here). However, its application goes much beyond the aims set for this project. In the first place, it creates a corpus of manually-tagged texts, annotated by human annotators and reviewed by second annotators, to which readers have access, with an interactive space enabling them to suggest corrections for any problem in the tags or in any part of the text itself through the issues reporting mechanism on our GitHub page. Besides, with a touch of creativity, such a corpus developed by spending so much time on preparing each single text can be freely used as a base by specialists who decide to work on specific texts in their area of specialty. In this blog post, I will try to explain how our annotated texts can be used to present enhanced versions of the texts, especially large biographical/bibliographical collections. By enhanced version, I mean a digital (and preferably online) version modified in order to facilitate using the content of the text for readers and also facilitate doing research on the text (or even more broadly on the genre of the text) for specialists. The text I will use here as an example is the famous Shiʿi bibliographical collection al-Dhari’a ila tasanif al-shi’a. Nevertheless, the suggestions and methods presented here are by no means limited to this text and can be applied to any other tagged bibliographical/biographical text on our corpus. To show how our tagged texts can be used for this purpose, first I will briefly explain what I, as the annotator, have done on it and will make some preliminary suggestions to improve the quality of the text; then I will show a few possibilities for the corpus which can be helpful for a wider audience interested in the text.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/images/blogs/2021-11-22/hamid_reza_hakimi/media/image2.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/images/blogs/2021-11-22/hamid_reza_hakimi/media/image2.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Dispatches from al-Tabari 8: The Afterlife of al-Tabari in Quotations</title><link href="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/Dispatches-from-al-Tabari-8-The-Afterli/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dispatches from al-Tabari 8: The Afterlife of al-Tabari in Quotations" /><published>2021-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://kitab-project-org.github.io/Dispatches-from-al-Tabari-8--The-Afterli</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/Dispatches-from-al-Tabari-8-The-Afterli/">&lt;p&gt;In this series of blog posts, we have argued for the imperative to rethink writerly culture in ways that allow for a more meaningful exploration of al-Tabari’s (d. 310/923) sources. We have also advanced a more general argument about the nature of writing in the period in which al-Tabari lived. The question that we should be asking is not whether a particular piece of writing constituted a published, redacted book but rather what forms writing took, what evidence we have of these forms in the works that survive, and how ideas about writing itself might have contributed to the evolution of the tradition – including the loss and oblivion of many of its layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have observed that al-Tabari rarely refers to titled works as his sources. Interestingly, Yaqut also fails to mention titles for al-Tabari’s sources in his discussion of his famed predecessor’s sources. Instead, he refers to ‘the book’, &lt;em&gt;kitab&lt;/em&gt;, of so-and-so. For example, Yaqut shares a report noting that al-Tabari failed to use the &lt;em&gt;kitab&lt;/em&gt; of Muhammad b. al-Saʾib al-Kalbi or those of Muqatil b. Sulayman or Muhammad b. ʿUmar al-Waqidi when composing his &lt;em&gt;tafsir&lt;/em&gt; (Yaqut’s source makes the point that al-Tabari did use these books in writing up his &lt;em&gt;taʿrikh&lt;/em&gt;). Yaqut uses the same general terminology – the &lt;em&gt;kitab&lt;/em&gt; of so-and-so – when describing the sources that al-Tabari did use when he wrote about &lt;em&gt;taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;siyar&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;akhbar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al-Tabari’s own writings were recognised early on as important works in their own right. His students copied them, and their titles are recorded in the early biographical works. Yaqut reproduces a comment he says he found in a volume of al-Tabari’s &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; in the handwriting of al-Tabari’s student Abu Muhammad ʿAbd Allah b. Aḥmad b. Jaʿfar al-Farghani (d. 362/972–3):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dear ʿAli b. ʿImran and Ibrahim b. Muhammad, I have given you an &lt;em&gt;ijaza&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;ajaztu la-ka&lt;/em&gt;) for the following books which I heard from Abu Jaʿfar al-Tabari (God have mercy on him!): the book on &lt;em&gt;tafsir&lt;/em&gt;, called &lt;em&gt;Jamiʿ al-bayan ʿan taʾwil ay al-Qurʾan&lt;/em&gt; and the book, &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh al-rusul wa’l-anbiyāʾ wa-l-muluk wa-l-khulafaʾ&lt;/em&gt;, both of which I heard (&lt;em&gt;samiʿtu&lt;/em&gt;); for &lt;em&gt;al-Qaṭʿayn min al-Kitab&lt;/em&gt;, which I did not hear, but which I obtained through an &lt;em&gt;ijaza&lt;/em&gt;; the book treating the dating of transmitters (&lt;em&gt;rijal&lt;/em&gt;), called &lt;em&gt;Dhayl al-mudhayyal &lt;/em&gt;…&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al-Farghani is remembered as a major transmitter of al-Tabari’s works. He wrote a continuation of the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;, and his son Abu Mansur Ahmad b. ʿAbd Allah in turn wrote a continuation of the continuation.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In the comment quoted by Yaqut, he tells two people – perhaps his own students – that he has received al-Tabari’s two major works in person through dictation. The &lt;em&gt;al-Qatʿayn min al-Kitab&lt;/em&gt; was transmitted through a mechanism that granted him permission to transmit the work without having heard it read aloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;al-qaṭʿayn&lt;/em&gt; is a curious one. Yaqut subsequently quotes Abu al-Hasan b. al-Mughallis who describes the contents of the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;, and says the term &lt;em&gt;al-qatʿayn&lt;/em&gt; refers to the &lt;em&gt;qatʿ&lt;/em&gt; of the Umayyads and the &lt;em&gt;qatʿ&lt;/em&gt; of the ʿAbbasids.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Ibn al-Nadim (d. 385/995) also refers to &lt;em&gt;qatʿan&lt;/em&gt;, when describing the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;. He says that al-Tabari added the &lt;em&gt;qatʿan&lt;/em&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; as well as other contents that ran up to the year 302.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This may well suggest an original conception of the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; that ended prior to the Umayyad period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For al-Tabari, and also his immediate readers, the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; therefore might have been viewed not as a continuous presentation of history, but rather as discrete segments added together and comprising it. Readers would know to read the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; differently depending on where in the narrative they landed. Segments on the Prophet’s life would be read differently than those on the Umayyads not just because of the topic, but also because of the manner of assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What authorized breaking books up? A significant factor would have been knowledge of their assembly, as was the case with the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; - both of the individual reports and also of the larger segments (e.g., the &lt;em&gt;qatʿayn&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;qatʿan&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;citing-al-tabari&quot;&gt;Citing al-Tabari&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should not assume that al-Tabari’s words were conveyed onwards in the form of published works, in the sense described by Schoeler. Nor should we assume that a person who passed on information from one of al-Tabari’s books necessarily had access to the whole work; we know that later authors did not, and even early users of his oeuvre may not have had the complete texts at their disposal. In the long term, the manuscript evidence points even more strongly to the partial transmission of al-Tabari’s works. For example, there is a not a single complete manuscript witness of the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;. Our text reuse data shows, furthermore, just how extensively the works were excerpted and reused at an early date and for centuries afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citations of al-Tabari point to a fragmentary reception of his writings, where subsequent generations passed on his works without direct reference to his works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have just begun work on a further data set that documents the afterlife of al-Tabari’s writings using manuscripts, text reuse data and citations of his works and his name. Within our data, we can already see that the &lt;em&gt;haddathani/haddathana&lt;/em&gt; formula was used to refer to subsequent persons’ connections back to him in a way that suggests his words passed into notebooks much like his teachers’ words had done. Like al-Tabari, these people also seem to have copied his material into notes that were then recycled into other works, some of which have come down to us. Although more work needs to be done to understand the usages of the &lt;em&gt;haddathani/haddathana&lt;/em&gt; formula in specific later works and contexts, it is noteworthy that it continued at all. Its persistence seems consistent with what scholars have described as the ongoing prestige of aurality.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To locate citations of al-Tabari, we created a regular expression that searched our database of machine-readable files of books written in the roughly 260-year period between al-Tabari’s death in 310/923 and the death of Ibn ʿAsākir in 571/1176. Our search targeted the following variant forms of Abu Jaʿfar Muhammad b. Jarir al-Tabari’s name combined with &lt;em&gt;haddathani/haddathana&lt;/em&gt; and its variants (a method similar to that which produced our data set on al-Tabari’s three books).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;محمد بن جرير&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;أبي جعفر الطبري&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;أبو جعفر الطبري&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;الطبري&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;أبا جعفر الطبري&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;أبي جعفر محمد بن جرير الطبري&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;أبو جعفر محمد بن جرير الطبري&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;أبا جعفر محمد بن جرير الطبري&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This search did not catch all occurrences of al-Tabari’s name in &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt;s written after his lifetime, because we excluded certain surface forms (such as Abu Jaʿfar and Ibn Jarir) that would have produced too many false hits. Even with the more restrictive formula, we found 315 instances of al-Tabari’s being cited in an &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt; across sixty-six works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, consider this long &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt; from Ibn ʿAsakir, which appears in his &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh madinat Dimashq&lt;/em&gt;. Ibn ʿAsakir invokes al-Tabari’s name within his biography of al-Walid II b. Yazid (r. 125-6/743-4) in the context of a report regarding the so-called third &lt;em&gt;fitna&lt;/em&gt;, during which Yazid b. al-Walid (r. approximately six months in 126/744) seized the caliphate by overthrowing his cousin al-Walid II:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I [Ibn ʿAsakir] read aloud to (&lt;em&gt;qaraʾtu ʿala&lt;/em&gt;) Abu al-Wafaʾ Huffāz b. al-Hasan b. al-Husayn from ʿAbd al-ʿAziz b. Ahmad, who said that ʿAbd al-Wahhab al-Maydani told us that Abu Sulayman b. Zabr said that ʿAbd Allah b. Ahmad b. Jaʿfar told him that Muhammad b. Jarir al-Tabari told him:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Ahmad b. Zuhayr told us that ʿAli b. Muhammad told him, from ʿAmr b. Marwan al-Kalbi, that Yaʿqub b. Ibrahim b. al-Walid told him that when Yazid b. al-Walid went out (&lt;em&gt;kharaja&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. rebelled), a &lt;em&gt;mawla&lt;/em&gt; belonging to al-Walid went out on a horse …&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt; in the second paragraph and the report can be traced to al-Tabari’s &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with some precisely reproduced phrasing (as well as some differences, which do not concern us here).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; itself is not mentioned. This is typical of Ibn ʿAsakir’s citations: even when referring to people who wrote books, he very often cites the people, not the books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both Ibn ʿAsakir’s text and the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; itself, al-Tabari’s direct informant is named as Ahmad b. Zuhayr (d. 279/892), who, according to Gilliot, wrote an &lt;em&gt;histoire&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;) of the caliphal period and attended the lessons of Musʿab b. ʿAbd Allah al-Zubayri (d. 233/848 or 236/851) on the genealogy of the Arabs.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Ibn al-Nadim attributes four works to Ahmad b. Zuhayr (&lt;em&gt;Kitab al-Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kitab al-Mutayyamin&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kitab al-Iʿrab&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Kitab Akhbar al-shuʿaraʾ&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this process, books were rendered doubly invisible. First, al-Tabari copied material from Ibn Zuhayr’s writings (which he obtained directly from the author) into his own &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;. Then, what al-Tabari wrote was converted back into note format for several generations (as witnessed in the &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt;). Finally, the material was absorbed into Ibn ʿAsakir’s &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh madinat Dimashq&lt;/em&gt;, with the identities of its previous book-form carriers – the writings of Aḥmad b. Zuhayr and al-Tabari – erased. In Ibn ʿAsakir’s work, these other writings have become invisible as books. Each of the people involved in this and similar chains of writing has gone to the trouble of creating a work. But it is as if each person afterwards has reserves credit for authoring a book only to himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;concluding-remarks&quot;&gt;Concluding Remarks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data for these blog posts was collected over several weeks during the Covid-19 pandemic. It was an extraordinary time to be buried in spreadsheets, doing this sort of intensive work. Perhaps it would have seemed less interesting in a different time. We did not set out to write eight posts, only two. But as we immersed ourselves in the data, we came to see the potential for gathering more data to address different aspects of the questions outlined at the start. In the months to come, we hope to publish our work in a peer-reviewed journal with additional reflections, data and corrections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method we are developing can be used with any text that is well structured (including having regularly marked paragraphs) and whose author cites sources according to a regular pattern. The Transmission Chains table can be filtered and sorted to address questions we have not raised (though keeping in mind the problems outlined in Post 2). The Name Normalisation table can be reused and expanded to, for example, study citation patterns in works written earlier or later. Scholars often work on a single book by a well-known author. The OpenITI corpus provides access to many less-known works, and digital methods applied to the entirety of an author’s surviving oeuvre can often shed more light on the author’s working methods than can close scrutiny of a single work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our data provided us with a complex new perspective on how al-Tabari worked, but we want to emphasise how much can also be learned by far more simple explorations. We encourage you to download the corpus through Zenodo and, as a matter of routine, to search individual works and the corpus broadly. Doing so will reveal hitherto unseen patterns, including in the structures of various works and in the frequencies of citation partners (as in our case). There is now a vast number of texts at your fingertips that you can not only read and search but also annotate and return to again and again on your own computer. We will be adding more book files to the OpenITI corpus in the future. If you do not see something that you would like to see in the corpus, please be in touch: if you can get hold of the work in question in a PDF file of reasonable quality, you can now create a machine-readable file of it through our Optical Character Recognition pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Digital Humanities is a field built on teamwork. We worked intensively together, even if separated by geography (Sarah in the United Kingdom and Masoumeh in Germany). We relied on the contributions, feedback and questions of a team of KITABis, whose input has been invaluable, and on those of reviewers of the project, especially Letizia Osti and Konrad Hirschler, who read these posts and improved them with their comments. We welcome your thoughts, too.&lt;/p&gt;

We have also advanced a more general argument about the nature of writing in the period in which al-Tabari lived. The question that we should be asking is not whether a particular piece of writing constituted a published, redacted book but rather what forms writing took, what evidence we have of these forms in the works that survive, and how ideas about writing itself might have contributed to the evolution of the tradition – including the loss and oblivion of many of its layers.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/images/thumbs/tabari_dispatches.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/images/thumbs/tabari_dispatches.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Dispatches from al-Tabari 7: Text Reuse Alignments</title><link href="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/Dispatches-from-al-Tabari-7-Text-Reuse/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dispatches from al-Tabari 7: Text Reuse Alignments" /><published>2021-10-25T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-10-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://kitab-project-org.github.io/Dispatches-from-al-Tabari-7--Text-Reuse-</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/Dispatches-from-al-Tabari-7-Text-Reuse/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post 7: Text Reuse Alignments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did al-Tabari create his extensive works? We contend that well-organised sets of notes played a critical role. Our argument relies on reasoning about the practicalities of working at scale, as well as our analysis of a data set consisting of thousands of citations that al-Tabari begins with the formula ‘he told me’/’he told us’ (&lt;em&gt;haddathani&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;haddathana&lt;/em&gt;). As demonstrated in previous posts, we have counted and tabulated these people who, he says, gave him information and have sketched visually (through tree maps) the bundles of notes he likely copied down and collated into notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also draw on text reuse alignments. As evidence, these are of an altogether different character and derive from a different data set. The alignments that we have identified between al-Tabari’s &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh al-rusul wa-l-muluk&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Jamiʿ al-bayan ʿan taʾwil ay al-Qurʾan&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;em&gt;Tahdhib al-athar&lt;/em&gt; (files Shamela0009783BK1, Shamela0007798 and JK008250Vols in the OpenITI corpus, respectively) consist of 1,374 rows in which a passage of at least ten words in one of the works overlaps with a passage in another of the works. The books are divided into chunks of 300-word tokens, so the maximum length of an identified alignment is 300 words. The largest share of the alignments found is between the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; (1,101), but there are also significant alignments between the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Tahdhib&lt;/em&gt; (229) and a few between the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Tahdhib&lt;/em&gt; (44). Of the alignments between the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;, 258 contain 100 words or more, and 54 exceed 200 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorithm that generated these alignments is called passim, and it is able to find aligned text passages rather well. For example, it recognises alignments even if the overlapping passage runs continuously in one text but contains additional insertions of phrases, names or other words in the other text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even short alignments often point to a shared source. The following brief alignment between the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;, provides an example. Differences are highlighted, and dashes mark a word missing from one of the parallel texts. Even without knowing Arabic, one can see that the differences are not substantial in terms of quantity. Both alignments begin by citing Ibn Ishaq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;, milestone 66:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;rtl&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; ابن اسحاق قال يقال والله اعلم خلق الله ادم ثم وضعه ينظر اليه اربعين يوما قبل ان ينفخ فيه الروح حتى عاد صلصالا كالفخار ولم تمسه نار قال فلما مضي له &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;, milestone 292:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;rtl&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; ابن اسحاق \-\--فيقال والله اعلم خلق الله ادم ثم وضعه ينظر اليه اربعين عاما قبل ان ينفخ فيه الروح حتي عاد صلصالا كالفخار ولم تمسه نار قال فيقال والله &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;, the passage is found in a section dedicated to the topic of Adam’s creation (&lt;em&gt;al-qawl fī khalq Ādam&lt;/em&gt;), and it is preceded by an &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt; going back to Muhammad b. Humayd (d. 248/862). The report begins with ‘Ibn Ishaq said’. The following translation loosely follows Rosenthal’s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ibn Ishaq said, reportedly (God knows best!), that God created Adam, then put him down and looked at him for forty days before blowing the spirit into him, until he became &lt;em&gt;ṣalṣāl&lt;/em&gt; like potter’s clay untouched by fire. [Ibn Ishaq] said that once [that period] had passed …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;, Ibn Ishaq is cited without an &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt;, and the word ‘said’ that follows his name in the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; precedes it, thus falling outside the alignment. More critically, in the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;’s version, God looked at Adam for forty years rather than forty days (&lt;em&gt;ʿāman&lt;/em&gt; versus &lt;em&gt;yawman&lt;/em&gt;). The passage appears in the context of commentary on Quran 2:30: ‘When your Lord said to the angels, I am putting a successor (&lt;em&gt;khalīfa&lt;/em&gt;) on earth, they said, “Will You place someone there who will cause corruption on it and shed blood, while we glorify You with Your praise and extol Your holiness?” [God] answered, “Surely, I know that which you do not know.”’&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous such closely related passages, and once passim has identified and output them into a CSV file, we can spot their differences. But in its current form, passim does not capture paraphrase unless it occurs within a chunk that otherwise aligns. In general, this means that we have a harder time finding evidence of reuse when an author actively revised the source text into his own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the longest alignments between the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;, both texts rely heavily on Muhammad b. Humayd’s transmission of Ibn Ishaq’s &lt;em&gt;Sira&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, of the ten longest alignments, all but one can be traced to Muhammad b. Humayd. The &lt;em&gt;Sira&lt;/em&gt; – as passed on by Muhammad b. Humayd – represents a major source common to all three of al-Tabari’s works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Muhammad b. Humayd, we find other direct informants. As an experiment, we searched through the passim output files for the surface forms of the ten most often cited direct informants. Of the 1,374 alignments, 555 contain one of the names – and in fact all ten top informants are named. Although this evidence is not extensive, it does suggest that al-Tabari reached back to the same trusted notebooks for his different works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not Copying Between Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general picture of text reuse yielded by our data set is one of a few extensive alignments and many more fragmentary ones. The most obvious explanation for this phenomenon is that al-Tabari used a common set of notes but adapted them differently in different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous scholars have held the view that al-Tabari did not copy wholesale the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; into the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; (or vice versa), and that is also what our data and visualisations suggest.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-10-25/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi/media/image1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-10-25/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi/media/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Image 1: Alignments between the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; (on the top) and the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; (on the bottom). Based on passim run of February 2021. Files compared: Shamela0009783BK1 and Shamela0007798.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest section of the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; that is aligned with the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; falls within a discussion of events in the Prophet’s lifetime, specifically concerning the Prophet’s wife ʿAʾisha. The arrangement owes much to &lt;em&gt;Sira&lt;/em&gt; material derived from Muhammad b. Humayd, and the frequency of mentions of Muhammad b. Humayd’s name in the aligned passages also points to both texts relying heavily on the &lt;em&gt;Sira&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-10-25/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi/media/image2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-10-25/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi/media/image2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Image 2: Alignments between the &lt;em&gt;Tahdhib&lt;/em&gt; (on the top) and the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; (on the bottom). Files compared: JK008250Vols and Shamela0009783BK1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, there are very few alignments between the &lt;em&gt;Tahdhib&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;, and no obvious pattern. The total number of aligned passages between these two works is forty-four, and the longest passage consists of 239 words. Eight further alignments contain 100 words or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-10-25/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi/media/image3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-10-25/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi/media/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Image 3: Alignments between the &lt;em&gt;Tahdhib&lt;/em&gt; (on the top) and the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; (on the bottom). Files compared: JK008250Vols and Shamela0007798.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the &lt;em&gt;Tahdhib&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;, there are a total of 229 aligned passages, the longest of which is 265 words. Of these alignments, forty-five contain at least 100 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In view of the most closely aligned sections in the two works, it is possible that al-Tabari used some short sections of the &lt;em&gt;Tahdhib al-āthār&lt;/em&gt; to write up a few parts of the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;, for example. Such consultations though would be few, if any at all. The general pattern and imprecision of the alignments do not support the conclusion that this was his primary modus operandi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our final blog post, we bring our exploration to a close with a brief but important reflection on how al-Tabari himself became a direct informant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We base our argument of the notebooks’ existence on practical evidence: the long interval between the time of writing and the time of his contact with the people he cites, the extensiveness of the citations (which would represent an astonishing feat of memory without written records) and the quick pace at which al-Tabari appears to have worked. There is also more direct evidence. This evidence consists of the citations themselves, including the ways in which they map onto probable notebooks, and of the alignments between all three books revealed by text reuse data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further point that emerges from our data set is the extent to al-Tabari appears to have gone back to the same sets of notes when composing each of his works. Let us look more closely at our data and numbers on this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewing all 849 names on our list of direct informants provides only a weak picture of sources common to the works. This list, as noted in an earlier post, contains many names that occur only once or twice in al-Tabari’s works, and the identities of many of them are uncertain. The list shows that al-Tabari relied on 347 direct informants for the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;, 543 for the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; and 342 for the &lt;em&gt;Tahdhib&lt;/em&gt;. Cross-checking pairs of these sub-lists shows that the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; have 139 direct informants in common, the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Tahdhib&lt;/em&gt; have 110 in common and the &lt;em&gt;Tahdhib&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; have 229 in common. All three works share 104 direct informants. These figures seem to suggest that he drew on many different sources and mostly used different sources for each work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the picture becomes more interesting when we focus on the smaller number of people on whom al-Tabari relied intensively. Recall that 51% of all of al-Tabari’s citations in our data set came from just eight people; twenty people accounted for 79% and fifty people for 89% of citations. It is these relatively few direct informants who mattered most to al-Tabari.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By focusing on this small subset we get a clearer picture of al-Tabari’s working habits. Of the fifty direct informants cited most frequently, thirty-eight are cited in all three of his works. Of the top twenty, eighteen appear in all three, and each of the top ten is cited in each work. In other words, al-Tabari’s most important direct informants constituted his core source base for all three of his works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among these direct informants, there is a further subset consisting of people cited numerous times in each of the three works. The &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; took years to complete, and in the drawn-out writing process, the notes from these informants were al-Tabari’s go-tos and trusted favourites. In their case it seems especially probable that he had at his disposal stable notes bound together for easy reference and citation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1: Four direct informants on whom al-Tabari relied heavily and whose material was likely preserved in well-organised notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among al-Tabari’s informants, Muhammad b. Humayd al-Razi (d. 248/862), Muhammad b. Bashshar (d. 252/866), Ab Kurayb (d. 248/862) and Muhammad b. al-Muthanna (d. 250/864) stand out. It is not hard to see why al-Tabari saw these individuals’ works as particularly worthy of careful collation and frequent citation. Muhammad b. Humayd transmitted Ibn Ishaq’s &lt;em&gt;Sira&lt;/em&gt;, an important source both for history (&lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;) and for interpretation of the Qur’an (&lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;; he is also cited 296 times in the &lt;em&gt;Tahdhib&lt;/em&gt; within our data set).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other figures are well-known Hadith scholars. Scott Lucas’s work on al-Tabari’s ‘teachers’ has shown that Hadiths from each of these three are cited in all six of the canonical Sunni Hadith collections (i.e. those of al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasaʾi and Ibn Maja).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These numbers are of interest for our understanding of knowledge transmission in the third/ninth and fourth/tenth centuries and beyond. How did an author whose works mattered so much to posterity put together his very large works? Reliable materials mattered. And those that al-Tabari deemed reliable he returned to again and again in his works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our next post, we examine text reuse alignments between al-Tabari’s works, which also suggest a common source base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we demonstrate that the data we have collected helps us begin to visualise the notebooks that served as al-Tabari’s ‘data carriers’.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Scholars have often mined al-Tabari’s citations for evidence of earlier works. They have given the lion’s share of their attention to reputed authors such as Mujahid and Sayf b. ʿUmar who lived two or more generations before al-Tabari. By contrast, our starting point is his direct informants and the material they passed on to al-Tabari. In some cases, they combined material from many different sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tree-maps&quot;&gt;Tree Maps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visualise al-Tabari’s notebooks using a tree map that was created from a subset of the &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt;s introduced by the phrases ‘he told me’/’he told us’ (&lt;em&gt;haddathana&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;haddathani&lt;/em&gt;) – specifically, &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt;s with at least three transmitters after al-Tabari. The tree map displays each person in an &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt; as a rectangle; the size of the rectangle is proportional to the number of times the person is cited. Our main tree map contains four layers of rectangles: al-Tabari himself (dark pink), his direct informants (dark orange), their informants (light orange) and the latters’ informants (yellow). For example, in the first notebook, Bishr b. Muʿadh’s (d. 245/859–60) main source is Yazid b. Zariʿ (d. 182/798-9?). All but twenty of the 2,387 chains that contain three persons after al-Tabari run thus: Bishr b. Muʿadh &amp;lt; Yazid b. Zariʿ &amp;lt; Saʿid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to stress that our tree maps do not represent the entirety of the data set, only the subset that fits their parameters. A tree map focused on &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt;s containing three transmitters will exclude all &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt;s that are shorter than three transmitters. Similarly, a tree map visualising &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt;s of at least five transmitters will exclude &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt;s with fewer than five, resulting in a smaller subset and a different tree map. Historians interested in the earliest layers of transmission may find the longer &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt; tree maps particularly interesting, as they highlight chunks of material that seem to have passed through multiple generations to al-Tabari’s direct informants and on to him. But they should remember that the data set was created to prioritise al-Tabari’s direct informants, not transmitters five generations removed from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The images included here are excerpts from a larger set of tree maps that we will publish with our data set in a forthcoming print publication. Bibliographical information is collated from publications by Gilliot, Athari and Lucas,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as well as from Ibn Nadim’s &lt;em&gt;Fihrist&lt;/em&gt; and the relevant &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia of Islam&lt;/em&gt; articles. We have also consulted other sources.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;six-sets-of-notes&quot;&gt;Six Sets of Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows is a series of visualisations of six possible – even likely – collections of notes used by al-Tabari.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notebook 1: Bishr b. Muʿadh&lt;/strong&gt; (d. 245/859–60), cited 2,418 times, filtered to 2,387 chains of at least three transmitters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-10-05/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi5/media/image1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-10-05/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi5/media/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image 1: The possible structure of al-Tabari’s notes on his lessons with Bishr b. Muʿadh in Basra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al-Tabari relies on Bishr b. Muʿadh chiefly for reports going back to an authority he calls Saʿid, transmitted via Yazid b. Zariʿ. Ibn al-Nadim mentions in his bio-bibliographical &lt;em&gt;Fihrist&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;em&gt;Kitab Saʿid b. Bashir ʿan Qatada&lt;/em&gt; within a list of compilations of Quran commentary (&lt;em&gt;tasmiyat al-kutub al-musannafa fi tafsir al-Qurʾan&lt;/em&gt;). Qatada b. Diʿama (d. ca. 117/735) was a ‘successor’, that is, he belonged to the generation of Muslims after the Prophet’s death. He was famed for his memory and his knowledge of genealogies, lexicography, historical traditions, Quranic exegesis, variant Quran readings (&lt;em&gt;qiraʾāt&lt;/em&gt;) and Hadith. As for Saʿid, Muhammad b. Saʿd (d. 230/845) has an entry for Abu ʿAbd al-Rahman Saʿid b. Bashir al-Azdi, who, he says, died in 170 (786 or 787 CE), at the start of Harun al-Rashid’s caliphate; he also mentions that Saʿid b. Bashir was from Basra but settled in Damascus. He quotes several reports from Qatada through Saʿid b. Bashir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look at the &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt;s that continue after Saʿid, we indeed find that nearly all go back to Qatada. But can we be sure that the Saʿīd who passed on material from Qatada was it Saʿid b. Bashir? We cannot. Al-Tabari received reports from Qatada through several routes, including via a transmitter he names explicitly as Saʿīd b. Bashīr and another he calls Saʿīd b. Abī ʿUrūba, who may or may not be the same person. It is perhaps significant that when he refers specifically to Saʿid b. Bashir as a source for Qatada, his direct informant was not Bishr b. Muʿadh but rather a variety of other people (as many as nine). This means that we cannot be certain that there is only one Saʿīd who reported from Qatada or that al-Tabari received material from Saʿid b. Bashir through Bishr b. Muʿadh .&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is where further work on named entities would be particularly useful. We can say, however, that whatever the origin of its contents, al-Tabari’s Bishr b. Muʿadh notebook contained a lot of material from Qatada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al-Tabari used this notebook mainly for the &lt;em&gt;Jāmiʿ al-bayān&lt;/em&gt;, but he also picked it up for the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; and a few times for the &lt;em&gt;Tahdhib&lt;/em&gt;. The citations from it in the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; all occur early in the book, with the last (at milestone 984) being found in al-Tabari’s reporting on the sixth year of the hijra. The sixth year is when the Prophet attempted to return to Mecca to make the lesser pilgrimage (&lt;em&gt;ʿumra&lt;/em&gt;) and ended up concluding the accord of al-Hudaybiyya (March 628). Al-Tabari cites Bishr as one of several sources on the events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notebook 2: Muhammad b. Humayd al-Razi&lt;/strong&gt; (d. 248/862), cited 2,879 times, filtered to 2,312 chains of at least three transmitters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-10-05/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi5/media/image2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-10-05/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi5/media/image2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image 2: The possible structure of al-Tabari’s notes on his lessons with Muhammad b. Humayd in Rayy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the frequency of citation, the notes al-Tabari obtained from Muhammad b. Humayd were by far the most important for the former’s works. Given the large number of quotations from these notes, they may have occupied numerous books or booklets. In biographical literature, Muhammad b. Humayd is well-known as a transmitter of Ibn Ishaq’s &lt;em&gt;Sira&lt;/em&gt; through the intermediary Salama b. al-Fadl, and it is likely that the material he transmitted from Ibn Ishaq was bound together. In this case, the difference between such notebooks versus a ‘book’ obtained through an &lt;em&gt;ijāza&lt;/em&gt; may have been slight. The data rightly challenges us to think harder not just about ‘actual books’ but also about the concept of notes and notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In writing the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;, our data would say that al-Tabari relied almost exclusively on the notes from Muhammad b. Humayd for Ibn Ishaq’s &lt;em&gt;Sira&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But for his other works he drew also on other notebooks containing material from the &lt;em&gt;Sira&lt;/em&gt;, especially those of Abu Kurayb (d. 248/862), Yaʿqub b. Ibrāhim al-Dawraqi (d. 252/866), and Sufyan b. Wakiʿ (d. 247/861), as well as at least seven others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the large number of citations represented in this tree map, we might imagine that the material al-Tabari obtained from Jarir b. ʿAbd al-Hamid, Mihran b. Abi ʿUmar and Abu Tamila Yahya b. Saʿid would likewise have been bound. But how these notebooks would have been stored within al-Tabari’s own shelving system is another question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly all material transmitted by Mihran from ‘Sufyan’ is quoted in the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; from Sura 41 (‘Fussilat’) onwards; this is most likely a collection of the exegetical opinions of Sufyan al-Thawri (d. 161/778). Al-Tabari also cites other direct informants for Sufyan al-Thawri’s opinions, including Yunus b. ʿAbd al-Aʿla (d. 264/877), Abu Kurayb (d. 248/862), and al-Harith b. Muhammad (d. 282/895), as well as the chains Muhammad b. Humayd &amp;lt; Salama b. al-Fadl &amp;lt; Sufyan and Muhammad b. Humayd &amp;lt; Harun &amp;lt; Sufyan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be worthwhile to compare the fragmentary Quran commentary attributed to Sufyan&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with al-Tabari’s &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;. We have not done this. But we do have a machine-readable &lt;em&gt;tafsir&lt;/em&gt; text attributed to Sufyan al-Thawri in the OpenITI corpus (under identifier Shia002462; 29,140 words),&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which has twelve short alignments with al-Tabari’s text; the longest of these measures sixty-one words.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notebook 3: Al-Muthanna b. Ibrahim al-Amuli&lt;/strong&gt; (d. unknown), cited 2,259 times, filtered to 1,973 chains of at least three people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-10-05/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi5/media/image3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-10-05/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi5/media/image3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image 3: The possible structure of al-Tabari’s notes from his lessons with al-Muthanna in Rayy (possibly Amul also).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notes that al-Tabari assembled from al-Muthanna b. Ibrahim al-Amuli are quite diverse, with the largest pieces deriving from transmitters named Ishaq b. al-Hajjaj and Abu Salih ʿAbd Allah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter appears in Ibn al-Nadim’s &lt;em&gt;Fihrist&lt;/em&gt; as Abu Salih ʿAbd Allah b. Muhammad b. Yazdad b. Suwayd (d. 223/837-8). Ibn al-Nadim calls him an eloquent scribe (&lt;em&gt;ahad al-kuttab al-bulaghaʾ&lt;/em&gt;) and attributes to him a &lt;em&gt;Kitab al-Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; and a book of epistles (&lt;em&gt;Kitab rasaʾilihi&lt;/em&gt;). Al-Tabari refers to him in the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Tahdhib&lt;/em&gt; as ‘the scribe of al-Layth’ (&lt;em&gt;katib al-Layth&lt;/em&gt;); al-Layth appears within the tree map, too. This seems to refer to the famous traditionist and &lt;em&gt;faqih&lt;/em&gt; al-Layth b. Saʿd (d. 175/791).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Abu Salih ʿAbd Allah also transmitted from Muʿawiya b. Salih. In our &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt;s, Muʿawiya’s reporting goes back to Ibn ʿAbbas through ʿAli b. Abi Talha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward Zychowicz-Coghill has recently collected witnesses to a &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; by al-Layth on the basis of a recension by Yunus b. Bukayr that is quoted in five other texts. He argues that al-Tabari did not draw on al-Layth’s &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, our data reveals additional evidence in the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; that contradicts his contention. Al-Layth is in fact cited in the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;, but through other &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt;s (and not, according to our data, through Yunus b. Bukayr).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al-Layth’s situation is complex, and readers will be forgiven if they find it a bit hard to follow. For us, the most important feature of it is that it allows us to discern how works that Ibn al-Nadim may have recognised as written works were broken down before al-Tabari’s lifetime, absorbed into subsequent writings, and then reabsorbed into al-Tabari’s book. This process seems to have carried memories of earlier works and their conservators (e.g. the reference to &lt;em&gt;katib al-Layth&lt;/em&gt;) but without either citing the works themselves or making an effort to keep them intact. That is why reconstructions are so tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of al-Tabari and, indeed, text reuse data in general, confirm what Beatrice Gruendler has recently argued, which is that in the third/ninth century (as well as beyond) the authorial agency of scholars such as al-Tabari was often exerted through acts of ‘memorizing, collecting, arranging, commenting, and transmitting of pre-existing sources’. As she writes, ‘This dealing with extant text made a scholar no less of an author in the eyes of his contemporaries, as he provided a repository of the knowledge that they needed.’ Gruendler distinguishes between different types of authorial agency. In poetry, authorship was recognised in the creation of a text, and a ‘basic difference already existed between a “ripped off” verbatim formulation and a borrowed reformulated motif’. In the case of poetry, ‘word-by-word’ copying was frowned on, though ‘a degree of reformulation changed the discourse from ownership to literary inspiration’.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we step back, we can understand these two forms of agency as part of a wider epistemology, which attributed greater prestige to adaptation than to simple, perfect reproduction. The reproduction of a work – as a &lt;em&gt;katib&lt;/em&gt; – did not initiate one into the genealogy of a master, whereas a student’s transmission of a teacher’s work (as a &lt;em&gt;rawi&lt;/em&gt; or otherwise) incorporated the student’s persona into the text’s lineage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hierarchy of prestige can be detected in al-Tabari’s citations. Consider the following examples, which indicate al-Tabari’s efforts to track specific pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notebooks 4 and 5:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Ismaʿil b. ʿAbd al-Rahman al-Suddi&lt;/strong&gt; (d. ca. 127/745) via &lt;strong&gt;Musa b. Harun al-Hamdani&lt;/strong&gt; (d. unknown) and &lt;strong&gt;Muhammad b. al-Husayn&lt;/strong&gt; (d. 261/874), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-10-05/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi5/media/image4.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-10-05/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi5/media/image4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image 4: The possible structure of al-Tabari’s notes from his lessons with Musa b. Harun al-Hamdani (d. unknown) and Muhammad b. al-Husayn (d. 261/874).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The direct informants here are the obscure Musa b. Harun and Muhammad b. al-Husayn al-Baghdadi, a Hadith scholar from Nisa in modern-day Turkmenistan). Both transmit through different intermediaries (ʿAmr vs. Ahmad) from Asbat b. Nasr al-Hamdani, who in turn transmits from al-Suddi, a &lt;em&gt;mawla&lt;/em&gt; who was a popular preacher in Kufa. In both cases, al-Suddi’s ‘box’ (that is, the material he provided) is neatly nested inside Asbat’s. However, the material from al-Suddī accounts for less than half of the three-person &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt;s from either Musa b. Harun (who starts a total of 508 chains) and or Muhammad b. al-Husayn (who starts 528).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examining these citations, G. H. A. Juynbol questioned the degree to which the material attributed to al-Suddi could be used to understand his views: ‘In al-Tabari’s &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;, countless exegetical remarks ascribed to al-&lt;em&gt;Suddi&lt;/em&gt; can be found and could conceivably be brought together in a volume. Whether such a compilation would allow conclusions as to a certain bias or predilection on his part, if any, has as yet to be established.’ Ibn al-Nadīm does indeed mention a &lt;em&gt;Kitab Tafsir al-Suddi&lt;/em&gt; within the section, mentioned above, that lists compilations of Quranic commentary (&lt;em&gt;tasmiyat al-kutub al-musannafat fi tafsir al-Qurʾan&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notebook 6: ʿAbd Allah b. al-ʿAbbas&lt;/strong&gt; (d. ca. 68/687–8) via Muhammad b. Saʿd (d. 276/889).&lt;/p&gt;

The information he received from the latter originates with ʿAbd Allah b. al-ʿAbbas (d. ca. 68/687–8), a member of the first generation of Muslims who is frequently called the father of Quranic exegesis. The full chain, in which the description of family relations reflects the respective quoted speaker’s perspective, runs as follows: Muhammad b. Saʿd &amp;lt; &lt;em&gt;abi&lt;/em&gt; [‘my father’] &amp;lt; &lt;em&gt;ʿammi&lt;/em&gt; [‘my paternal uncle’, i.e. Muhammad b. Saʿd’s great-uncle] &amp;lt; &lt;em&gt;abihi&lt;/em&gt; [‘his father’, i.e. the great-uncle’s father] &amp;lt; Ibn ʿAbbas. Franz Rosenthal described al-Tabari’s material from Muhammad b. Saʿd as an ‘unpublished’ book and ‘the heirloom of a particular family’ and noted that ‘a family &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt; as complete as this is most remarkable’.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:12&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that although generating our data was challenging, once generated it is relatively easy to read. Filtering the data in the Transmission Chains table to order the &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt;s alphabetically by the name in position 5, for example, reveals numerous identical &lt;em&gt;isnads&lt;/em&gt; running back to Ibn ʿAbbas. The interpretation of these &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt;s will, of course, remain a subject of debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Limits of Our Argument&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars such as Lawrence Conrad, Andrew Rippin, Ella Landau-Tasseron and Arietta Papaconstantinou have rightly raised questions about efforts to reconstruct lost sources.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:13&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There is an understandable concern in the field about the risks associated with mining later sources for evidence of earlier ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work is a comparatively modest effort. Our primary focus is on what al-Tabari had to hand, not on whether any given chunk of material can in fact be traced back to Umayyad times. We make no judgement, for example, about whether the Ibn ʿAbbas notebook actually goes back to the man himself. Indeed, we are sceptical that the notebooks can be reconstructed. Instead, they can be described, given that we possess only extracts from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the earlier layers, we are also generally sceptical about the possibility of reconstructing ‘actual books’ from earlier time periods on the basis of quotations and citations found in works that survive today. Our scepticism arises from the fact that authors treated their notes as reusable materials. Now that technology can aid us in new ways, further work on assessing alignments will be worthwhile, but we should be searching for more nuanced ways to describe what we find. What was the nature of these earlier works? Corpora of quotations can be collected and described and sketches of the early written tradition developed on the basis of this evidence, as Kevin Jaques is doing for Ibn Ishaq and as Zychowicz-Coghill has done for al-Layth b. Saʿd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main bone of contention with efforts at reconstruction that mine later sources for earlier works is that they often give little or no attention or agency to the persons we call al-Tabari’s direct informants. Al-Tabari drew on a material reality that had its own form and organisation. Broadly speaking, our work reflects the field’s rising attention to the materiality of texts, although we do not work with manuscripts. Rather, we direct our attention to where the material has vanished but direct citations of it remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our next post, we compare al-Tabari’s books and investigate how different notebooks fed into different works.&lt;/p&gt;

Saʿd al-Misri), but in our data set this name never appears in the al-Muthanna &amp;lt; ʿAbd Allah chains, which refer only to ‘al-Layth’. Al-Tabari may well have maintained in his citations the different surface forms of names that he had recorded in his notes. Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi (d. 463/1071) describes an ʿAbd Allah b. Saliḥ b. Muhammad b. Muslim Abu Salih as an Egyptian who was the &lt;em&gt;katib al-Layth b. Saʿd&lt;/em&gt; and who accompanied the latter to Baghdad. The names here do not quite match (ʿAbd Allah b. Muhammad versus ʿAbd Allah b. Salih).

He mentions hundreds of people in this manner – but a very small subset of them accounts for the majority of his citations. Al-Tabari’s three works contain a vast amount of material from direct informants, and most of that material came into his possession early in his life, a long time before he composed his books. It is our contention that al-Tabari made use of an extensive written record to preserve and organise his material over the decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-notes&quot;&gt;Why Notes?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contention may be met with scepticism. One might argue that al-Tabari memorised the information he obtained from his informants and could recall it without the need for written aids. Memorisation of reports was a culturally valued skill in his time. However, there are five main reasons to think that he in fact drew on well-written and well-organised notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The long time – as much as half a century – that had elapsed between his contact with the sources and his writing (see the previous post).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extensiveness of the citations. There are thousands of pieces of information from different informants scattered across thousands of pages of his works. Citation chains featuring direct informants alternate with other citation chains, disappear for hundreds of pages and then reappear. The feats of medieval memory defy our imagination today, and we do well not to underestimate its role and importance. But the rote recall and deft manipulation of purely oral information on such a scale does seem highly unlikely. A model of memory operating like an index is more plausible: al-Tabari had an extensive mental map of his data, which allowed him to locate what he needed in his notes as he created his own works, drawing on, but not merely reproducing, earlier writings with their own forms. All three of his works are highly structured, by chronology (&lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;), Quranic chapters (&lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;) or early traditionists (&lt;em&gt;Tahdhib&lt;/em&gt;). Al-Tabari’s memory feat was to map the contents of these earlier works, with their own forms, into his own.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The efficiency of al-Tabari’s work. Much of the material he incorporated into his own works may already have been systematically arranged along lines similar to the structure of his own works. But his fast writing pace can also be explained by a well-organised collection of written material – that is, notebooks that he had compiled in specific times and contexts during his youth and that he returned to again and again. The most often used notebooks, based on notes collected from only a few persons, a crucial role for al-Tabari. He relied heavily on them as well as on other written sources, including another written source, whose extensive reuse by al-Tabari can be detected in our data (though he does not cite the work).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The regular citation of the same transmission chains pointing back to earlier written works. Al-Tabari relied substantially on information from individuals who lived before him, many of whom are reported to have written books of their own. Although he could not have met these people in person, his most important direct informants provided him with access, possibly only lightly mediated, to these earlier compositions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The three works’ close (though not exact) alignments with other surviving texts, including al-Tabari’s own. When using earlier texts, he appears to have made adjustments to them to fit the thematic interests of his own books.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Franz Rosenthal already noted al-Tabari’s probable use of notebooks as well as the scarcity of his citations of actual books by others. He concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There can be no doubt that the ‘I was told’ and ‘we were told’ at the opening of chains of transmitters have as a rule to be taken literally as indicating direct personal contact or contact within the setting of public lectures and instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosenthal nonetheless discerned a pretence of orality in al-Tabari’s citations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It must also be assumed that he often referred to someone with whom he undoubtedly had some personal contact, but later, he used the source that was transmitted to him by that individual in its written (published) form and quoted from it while pretending all the time to rely upon oral transmission.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our view, it is more reasonable to read al-Tabari’s citations with &lt;em&gt;haddathani&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;haddathana&lt;/em&gt; as explicit acknowledgement of material that he received orally and recorded in his notes and notebooks. By using these distinctive phrases (and differentiating them from phrases such as &lt;em&gt;dhukira ʿan&lt;/em&gt;), he was emphasising that the transmission took place through personal contact, which was considered more prestigious and more authoritative than transmission of written material alone. From al-Tabari’s perspective, he was saying exactly what he was doing; there was no pretence involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gregor Schoeler’s depiction of aurality among Muslim writers of the third/ninth century may partly explain al-Tabari’s learning situation. As noted in our first blog post, in his discussion of forms of writing in this period, Schoeler distinguished between essentially private notes and notebooks (&lt;em&gt;hypomnēmata&lt;/em&gt;, sing. &lt;em&gt;hypomnēma&lt;/em&gt;), on the one hand, and ‘actual books, composed and redacted according to the canon of stylistic rules, and intended for publication’ (&lt;em&gt;syngrammata&lt;/em&gt;, pl. &lt;em&gt;syngramma&lt;/em&gt;), on the other. The Arabic tradition refers to both types as books (&lt;em&gt;kutub&lt;/em&gt;, sing. &lt;em&gt;kitāb&lt;/em&gt;). Before the third/ninth century, the conventions that would later mark a ‘published’ book had not yet crystallised, and accordingly many books written in that period do not survive, while others, such as the &lt;em&gt;Sira&lt;/em&gt; of Ibn Ishaq and the &lt;em&gt;Muwaṭṭaʾ&lt;/em&gt; of Malik b. Anas, survive in multiple variant versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Book historians have identified the third/ninth century as a turning point at which &lt;em&gt;syngrammata&lt;/em&gt; began to flourish. Most recently, Beatrice Gruendler has painted a detailed picture of this century, in which books appeared as ‘new media’. Al-Tabari’s numerous and extensive writings represent a milestone that ought to be considered in any periodisation of book history. It is hard to imagine them coming into existence fifty years earlier, when he was still a student and the ‘rise of the Arabic book’ was only beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But did scholars such as al-Tabari view the materials at their disposal in strictly binary terms – as either notes/notebooks or ‘actual books’ or, to put it differently, as either ‘published’ or unpublished works? Al-Tabari gives little indication of such binary thinking in his citations. We might look for a distinction in how he cites people (whose information he recorded as notes) versus how he cites redacted books (which he accessed without direct contact with the authors). But he only rarely acknowledges books as his sources. Even when he cites someone known to have authored a relevant book, he usually fails to mention the work in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when citing reports from Sayf b. ʿUmar (d. during the reign of al-Rashid, r. 170–93/786–809), al-Tabari repeatedly uses phrasing that suggests he accessed Sayf’s work in the form of written material acquired by al-Sari, who himself relied on Shuʿayb (&lt;em&gt;wa-amma al-Sari, fa-innahu qala fi kitabihi ilayya&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;haddathana Shuʿayb ʿan Sayf&lt;/em&gt; …).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Modern scholars, mostly basing their discussions on al-Tabari’s &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;, have speculated about the nature of Sayf’s work, which no longer survives, primarily for the purpose of assessing its reliability (or lack thereof) as a source for the events it relates.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The title &lt;em&gt;Kitab al-Futuh al-kabir wa-l-ridda&lt;/em&gt; as the name of Sayf’s lost work does not appear in the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;; its widespread use and attribution today appear to derive from Ibn al-Nadim’s (d. 385/995) &lt;em&gt;Fihrist&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that what is required for a more nuanced understanding of al-Tabari’s work and the literary culture of his time is deeper probing of the variety of written forms that existed and were likely to be used by people such as al-Tabari. What forms might notes have taken? What sorts of ways of binding material together can we imagine? It may have been conventional within &lt;em&gt;isnad&lt;/em&gt;s to mention individuals and not their works, but what does this convention tell us about how authors such as al-Tabari thought about the works at their disposal and what they could expect in terms of the treatment of their own works afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This line of enquiry requires an openness to the many ways in which al-Tabari and his peers might have constructed and conceived of their own works. It could have the effect of demoting ‘actual books’ as the main, privileged carriers of information in the third/ninth and fourth/tenth centuries and beyond.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Therefore, we would do well to broaden our understanding of authorship to include many forms of writing and writerly culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aligning-al-tabaris-books&quot;&gt;Aligning al-Tabari’s Books&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence of text reuse in al-Tabari’s works indicates that he drew repeatedly on the same written sources in his writings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-10-05/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi4/media/image1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blogs/2021-10-05/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi4/media/image1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image 1. An excerpt from a longer alignment (displayed furthest to the right, with the excerpt circled in red) between passages based on Ibn Ishaq’s &lt;em&gt;Sira&lt;/em&gt; in al-Tabari’s &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; (on the right; OpenITI, Shamela0009783, milestones 596–604) and in his &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; (on the left; OpenITI, Shamela0007798, milestones 9635–41). Text found only in the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; is highlighted in green; text found only in the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; is highlighted in blue. The long green block comes from Hisham b. Muhammad al-Kalbi. Alignment generated with Ryan Muther’s adaptation of David Smith’s passim software and fed into the OpenITI Diff viewer application (created by Peter Verkinderen, who also designed the way to visualise the location of the excerpt within the whole).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alignment shown on the far right side of Image 1 covers ten consecutive pages in the Leiden edition of the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; and almost the same in the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is one of the longest alignments between the two works. Looking at it gives the impression that one is seeing the seams that run between and link the works. The passages overlap very closely, but they have slight wording differences that could reflect al-Tabari’s own different readings of the text that he received from Muhammad b. Humayd in Rayy while in his teens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closeness of the two texts is evident in the very first sentences in the alignment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;: He [Ibn Ishaq] said: Abraha then built al-Qalis (or al-Qullays) in Sanʿaʾ. He built a church (&lt;em&gt;kanisa&lt;/em&gt;) unlike any seen on earth in its time. Afterwards, he wrote to the Negus, the king of the Abyssinians, saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;O king! I have built for you a church (&lt;em&gt;kanisa&lt;/em&gt;) the like of which has never been built for any king before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;: He [Salama b. al-Fadl] said: Ibn Ishaq told us (&lt;em&gt;haddathana&lt;/em&gt;) that Abraha built a church (&lt;em&gt;kanisa&lt;/em&gt;) in Sanʿaʾ. He was Christian and called it (&lt;em&gt;sammaha&lt;/em&gt;) al-Qalis (or al-Qullays). It was unlike any seen on earth in its time. He wrote to the Negus, the king of the Abyssinians, saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;O king! I have built for you a church (&lt;em&gt;kanisa&lt;/em&gt;) the like of which has never been built for any king before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For al-Tabari, the account of the building of the church in Sanʿaʾ may have been a familiar story, one that he taught regularly in his afternoon teaching sessions in Baghdad. When he sat down to compose the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;, the text of this story was well known to him; it was alive in his memory. Writing it down may have been akin to singing for him, insofar as he had internalised the text down to the level of the words and so could improvise when addressing his audience. In the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;, he seems to have added the clarification that Abraha was a Christian and that the church he built was called al-Qalis (or al-Qullays). The beginning of the story is thus similar but not identical in the two texts, but when quoting the Negus’s letter al-Tabari appears to have returned to his notes to ensure verbatim accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both reports rely on a transmission chain that ran from his direct informant, Muhammad b. Humayd (d. 248/862), through Salama b. al-Fadl (d. after 190/805-6) to Ibn Ishaq (d.c. 151/768), though the chain is cited explicitly in connection with this story only in the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; (in the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt;, al-Tabari gives the chain earlier in the text, at the beginning of the overall narrative, without repeating it thereafter). It is likely that the clarification in the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt; was added by al-Tabari himself, though we cannot know for sure without access to the notes themselves. It is also possible that the clarification was already present in al-Tabari’s notes, or that both texts differ slightly from the text recorded in the notes. Or that a copyist or copyists were involved along the way. We do not, at present, have an earlier, independent text of Ibn Ishaq’s work against which to compare al-Tabari’s version, but a cursory look at text reuse data for this passage in works written after al-Tabari’s lifetime suggests that the version in the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; aligns more closely with other transmissions of Ibn Ishaq’s text than does the version in the &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of al-Tabari’s notes would have been thoroughly familiar to him, but others he would have known less well, perhaps because he never taught from them, even if he drew on them for his works. Infrequently recalled material – like a melody one has heard only once or twice long ago, to continue the singing metaphor – would not lend itself so easily to improvisation or expansion. It is possible that the many much shorter and often very precise alignments between al-Tabari’s works reflect instances in which he reproduced such less familiar material from his notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of his long and illustrious career, al-Tabari was extraordinarily productive in several different fields, including Quran commentary, history and law (in his catalogue of authors, Ibn al-Nadim places him in the chapter on &lt;em&gt;ʿulamaʾ&lt;/em&gt;). We might reasonably speculate that al-Tabari copied parts of his &lt;em&gt;Taʾrikh&lt;/em&gt; into his &lt;em&gt;Tafsir&lt;/em&gt;, or vice versa. That would have been efficient. But the text reuse data indicates that that is not how he generally worked. Instead, it seems that he went back to the same sources again and again in the course of composing each of his works. We examine the alignments between his works more closely in a later post, when we consider his reliance on notebooks for his three major works.&lt;/p&gt;

He mentions hundreds of people in this manner – but a very small subset of them accounts for the majority of his citations. Al-Tabari’s three works contain a vast amount of material from direct informants, and most of that material came into his possession early in his life, a long time before he composed his books. It is our contention that al-Tabari made use of an extensive written record to preserve and organise his material over the decades.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/images/blogs/2021-10-05/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi4/media/image1.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://kitab-project-org.github.io/images/blogs/2021-10-05/sarah_savant_masoumeh_seydi4/media/image1.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
